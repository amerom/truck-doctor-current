They’re just better than the absolute bottom of the heap intel integrated graphics. Earlier releases of MATLAB may run but are not fully supported. GPU performance is measured running models for computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), text-to-speech (TTS), and more. The new tensorflow_macos fork of TensorFlow 2.4 leverages ML Compute to enable machine learning libraries to take full advantage of not only the CPU, but also the GPU in both M1- and Intel-powered Macs for dramatically faster training performance.
