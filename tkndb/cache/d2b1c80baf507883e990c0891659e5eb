Even though some mussels might appear to be badly damaged, it’s always worth cooking them as they could still open. Add 4 pounds scrubbed mussels or clams, cover the pot, and turn the heat to high. Add the butter and, when it has melted, add the shallots. A thorough rinse in water and removal of "the beard" is suggested. Place a medium sized pot over medium high heat. Wash the mussels with a stiff kitchen brush under cool running water and … Add a splash of water. If you find one with a slightly open shell, tap it gently with your finger; if it doesn't immediately close, put it in the discard pile. But good that you tossed them.
