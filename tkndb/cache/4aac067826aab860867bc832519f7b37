Compact bone has a structure made up of osteons. (2 points) Bone tissue is composed of bone cells and extracellular matrix. 00:29. Spongy bones are made up of trabeculae. Also, osteogenic cells are responsible for secreting bone matrix as a ring known as lamella. Compact bone histology is actually really fascinating -- if you look at a compact bone microscope slide, you can really see the difference between compact bone and spongy bone. If the activity of osteoclasts exceeds the activity of osteoblasts in a bone, how will the mass of the bone be affected? Compact bone. ... 1.Compact and spongy bones are the two main types of osseous tissues. They surround a tiny, central canal known as Haversian canal. What are the functional relationships between compact and spongy bone? The trabeculae are lined by a celluler membrane called endosteum. Occurs in skull bones, vertebrates, ribs and epiphysis of long bones. The main difference between spongy and compact bones is their structure and function.
