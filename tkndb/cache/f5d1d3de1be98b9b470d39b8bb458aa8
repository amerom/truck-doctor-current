Purpose Calcitonin is often ordered for cancer patients experiencing bone pain due to metastasis . vermehrte renale Kalziumreabsorption. Cholecalciferol Vs Calcitriol . Finally, calcitonin usually acts as the opposition to the functions of parathyroid hormone through preventing osteoclasts and increasing the levels of excreting calcium into the urine through the kidneys. It promotes absorption of calcium from the intestine by forming a … Serum calcium concentration is highly regulated by a complex system of calciotropic hormones. Calcitriol is in plasma bound to transcalciferin and this results in a long calcitriol half-life in plasma (5–12 h).Abundance of bound calcitriol molecules prevents the exact and quick control of its effects and makes it an inert regulator with a time lag between the changes of calcitriol synthesis and its effect on peripheral tissues.
