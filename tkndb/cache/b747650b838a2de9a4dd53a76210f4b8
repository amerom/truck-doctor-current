Nevada has long been known as a business-friendly jurisdiction with favorable corporation and LLC laws and courts that have proven to uphold the corporate veil, now it has stepped out front as the domestic jurisdiction of choice for settling an asset protection trust. I'm a NV resident, so the residency requirement is not an issue. Nevada is one of a few states that enacted legislation allowing for the creation of self-settled spendthrift trusts, these on-shore trusts are often referred to as Domestic Asset Protection Trusts.The Nevada Asset Protection Trust (NAPT), is Nevadaâs law regarding the Domestic Asset Protection Trust. The court noted that the requirements for setting up such trusts were met and the intent to do so was clear from the unambiguous language of the trusts.
