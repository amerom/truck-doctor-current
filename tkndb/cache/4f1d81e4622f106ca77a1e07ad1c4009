The initial structure formed is a pre-pro-PTH, a 115 amino acid polypeptide that is cleaved to form pro-PTH comprised of 90 amino acids. This, in turn, allows the body to absorb more of the calcium it digests from food. All of these actions of parathyroid hormone are enhanced b 1,25 dihroxycholecalciferol, a hormone produced in the kidneys. The parathyroid glands are four, oval-shaped endocrine glands located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland. It is occasionally secreted by cancer cells (breast cancer, certain types of lung cancer including squamous cell carcinoma). Small changes in serum calcium are sensed by the parathyroid G-protein coupled calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) and alter PTH secretion, gene expression, and if prolonged parathyroid cell proliferation. In evolution, parathyroid glands first appear in terrestrial vertebrates, and their existence is closely linked to the need to maintain adequate levels of ionized calcium in blood. Parathyroid hormone, secreted by the parathyroid glands embedded in the thyroid, acts to increase plasma calcium levels. Nan Li, Ari M. Chow, Hashwin V. S. Ganesh, Melanie Ratnam, Ian R.
