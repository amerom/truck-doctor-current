Levels of BUN have also been linked to the presence of high blood pressure and diseases that restrict the flow of blood such as diabetes. Causes. If the cause of your abnormal BUN levels is kidney disease, you may be prescribed certain medications to slow down the progression of your disease during early stages. Your doctor will give you specific instructions. To estimate normal ranges of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Cr) levels in the aged, we measured BUN and Cr levels in 332 cases of apparent-healthy elderly subjects (male, 152; female, 180) aged 70 years or more. See our safety precautions in response to COVID-19. Normal levels of creatinine in the blood are approximately 0.6 to 1.2 milligrams (mg) per deciliter (dL) in adult males and 0.5 to 1.1 milligrams per deciliter in adult females. Your result will be a number that measures how much BUN is in your blood. We measured the variables also in 315 cases of sex-matched young control subjects (male, 139; female, 176). Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) - Normal Range. Logistics Test Indications: The urea nitrogen level, along with creatinine, is used to evaluate kidney function, and used to monitor patients with kidney failure or those receiving dialysis therapy. The liver produces urea in the urea cycle as a waste product of the digestion of protein. The nitrogen combines with other elements, such as carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, to form urea, which is a chemical waste product. This protein is then metabolized to BUN by the liver. The kidneys filter urea and throw it out, via urine. What are the Indications for Blood Urea Nitrogen? Normal. Accessed May 9, 2016. A BUN test measures the amount of urea nitrogen that's in your blood. In medical, the normal range of urea nitrogen in blood is 3.2~7.1mmol/L or 9~20mg/dl.
