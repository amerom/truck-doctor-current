The Southeastern American Kestrel is listed as threatened in Florida due to an overall decline in nesting and foraging habitat, specifically the removal of isolated trees from agricultural fields, residential development, conversion of open pinelands to agriculture, and the modification of pine forest understory vegetation resulting from fire suppression. Eggs are white to reddish-brown with a dark speckling. There should be a minimum of 124 acres (50 hectares) of appropriate habitat surrounding each nest box, and individual nest boxes should be spaced approximately one-half mile from each other. Nest boxes should be located in relatively open areas, such as sandhills, fields, pastures, and golf courses where natural cavities are lacking.
