During feeding, a coral polyp will extend its tentacles out from its body and wave them in the water current where they encounter zooplankton, bacterioplankton, or other food particles. Generally they will eat micro-plankton, small brine shrimp, fish detritus, rotifers, and copepods. It is difficult to generalize the food requirements for groups (LPS, SPS or soft) of corals as there are always a few renegades in each group which have a more selective diet. Examples include brain coral, elegance, and Plate corals. Another one is the nudibranch. Corals are animals with a have tiny, tentacle-like arms that they use to capture their food from the water and sweep into their inscrutable mouths. Instead, they stick out tentacles to catch prey items like zooplankton (animal-like organisms that live in aquatic environments) and other food particles. Feeding some high-quality Coral Food from Fauna Marin. The third important source of food for corals is bacterioplankton, which consists of free-living bacteria as well as the bacteria associated with various materials in the water (mucas, dead plant material, and other particulate matter) which are commonly called detritus or reef snow.

Corals by Coral Reef Conservation Program, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Stan and Debbie have worked in the aquarium fish field for over three decades and written 300+ articles about pet fish. Almost all corals feed heavily on bacterioplankton. Examples of direct feeding include feeding bigger corals diced fish, frozen plankton, phytoplankton, krill, pieces of shrimp, squid, or clams. Many corals also contain symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae. Most soft corals, zoanthids, and gorgonians depend almost exclusively on phytoplankton, (small water-borne plants or algae) for their nutritional needs as well as floating plankton, detritus, and slow-moving invertebrate larvae, rather than zooplankton (which can actively propel itself).
