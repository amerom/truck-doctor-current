In some countries however, unmarried cohabitation of a couple for a specific period of time does create a presumption of paternity similar to that of formal marriage. While Christina and James were confident in their decision to enter into a commitment (such as a 20-year mortgage), they are unsure if they want to enter into marriage.

[219] Many of the largest Christian denominations regard marriage as a sacrament, sacred institution, or covenant. The Covenant Code orders "If he take him another; her food, her clothing, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish(or lessen)". These may include, depending on jurisdiction: These rights and obligations vary considerably between societies, and between groups within society. Separate property systems can however be used to prevent property of being passed on to partners after divorce or death. Some countries do not recognize locally performed religious marriage on its own, and require a separate civil marriage for official purposes. [citation needed], For a Muslim wedding to take place, the bridegroom and the guardian of the bride (wali) must both agree on the marriage. No group of people may be fenced out of this right â¦ In India, thousands of dowry-related deaths have taken place on yearly basis,[87][88] to counter this problem, several jurisdictions have enacted laws restricting or banning dowry (see Dowry law in India).
