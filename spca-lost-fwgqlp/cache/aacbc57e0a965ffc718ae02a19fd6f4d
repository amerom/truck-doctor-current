The new Cee’d MPV will be unveiled sometime in 2013 and will be fighting against the Volkswagen Touran, the Ford C-Max, and the Mazda 5, among others. This is what commitment looks like: competition! Kia will unveil at the Frankfurt Motor Show a facelift version for the Kia Cee’d hatchback. For the first time in a performance hatchback from Kia, the new Ceed GT will be available with an optional seven-speed double-clutch transmission, in addition to the standard six-speed manual gearbox. "Cameron was up for it too so we’re getting two A-list stars for one show. Not surprisingly, it was penned at the company’s European design center in Frankfurt, only 500 meters (0.3 miles) from where it will be unveiled. Sport mode enhances throttle and transmission responses, enables maximum acceleration – from a standstill and at speed – and adapts the steering to offer additional weight and more decisive responses to inputs. There are a lot of new details about the hatchback, but none is more important than Kia’s decision to spell the Ceed’s name the way it’s supposed to in the first place.

If that ends up being the case, these spy photos of the five-door Proceed are arriving at just the right time. At the front of the vehicle is Kia’s new trademark "tiger-nose" grille and aggressive, wraparound headlamp clusters housing signature LED daytime running lights. Kia's answer for the VW GTI (in Europe, at least). The cee’d also gets a fully-revised suspension set-up. Described as an "extended hot hatch that presents a new body type for Kia," the Proceed concept appears to be the bastard child of a Kia Stinger and a low, sleek shooting brake. UPDATE 09/28/2012: This review has been updated with the official details, images and specs. Soul and Sportage; 2021 Kia Seltos vs 2020 Kia Sportage; 2020 Kia Soul GT-Line vs 2020 Kia Soul GT-Line Turbo; 2021 Kia Seltos EX vs Seltos SX Turbo; 2021 Kia Sorento vs 2020 Kia Telluride ; Trim Comparisons: Kia.

As until now, the Kia Ceed will go against tough competition in Europe. In profile, it is finished with a glossy chrome window surround and features more substantial side sills, finished in gloss black and red. The rest is all about soft and high quality materials. Details are still unclear, but the model is expected to arrive sometime in the middle of 2019.
