The Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD) is a standardized, prospective tool for tracking nightly subjective sleep. Upon reviewing the draft version of the CSD-M, participants offered a variety of opinions regarding alternative format and layouts. Center for Sleep & Circadian Science Department of Psychiatry University of Pittsburgh 3811 O’Hara Street Pittsburgh, PA 15213. View All Events. A smaller subset of experts formed a committee and reviewed the compiled diaries. You can access your diary entries from any internet-connected device. Of those responding, 50% reported there should be an option for completing some items at night, 33% reported that evening completion should not be an option, and 17% reported that this option should be available for asking about daytime functioning only, e.g. The questions ask about: (1) the time of getting into bed; (2) the time at which the individual attempted to fall asleep; (3) sleep onset latency; (4) number of awakenings; (5) duration of awakenings; (6) time of final awakening; (7) final rise time; (8) perceived sleep quality (rated via Likert scale); and (9) an additional space for open-ended comments from the respondent. Today’s date (include month/day/year): Mon* Tues Wed Thurs Fri Sat Sun. The Insomnia Severity Index 2 and Consensus Sleep Diary 3 are examples of clinically practical, sensitive outcome measures. For CSD-M, mean sentence length was 9.2 words (SD 2.5, range 5-14), and mean lexile Measure was 555 (SD 255, range 160-1040), corresponding to a third-grade reading level (range first-eighth grade). C. M. (2012). For example, if an item set contained no options worded in the past tense or second person, new items were constructed. Put the letter “C” in the box when you have coffee, cola or tea. Sleep 2012;35(2):287-302. This is not usually a problem. 10:15 p.m. 2. naps, energy, mood. The current study examined psychometric properties of two retrospective questionnaire versions of the Consensus Sleep Diary. Advantages of the CSD in particular include the use of both expert consensus and qualitative patient input, as recommended for development of reliable and valid patient-report instruments.20 This methodology included collecting and incorporating diaries currently in use in the field, consensus group editing and composing of items, employing focus groups to solicit input of subjects/patients both for diary development and for editing, solicitation of feedback from experts in the insomnia research community, and carrying out lexile analysis.

Organa provides data solutions to manage prospective behavioral monitoring for patients Alternate forms of the CSD would be developed to offer researchers optimal flexibility in addressing research questions. Your Name_____ The date of Day 1_____ Enter … The term “bed” means the place where you usually sleep. In the sleep diary, the word “day” is the time when you choose or are required to be awake. The Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD) is a standardized, prospective tool for tracking nightly subjective sleep. Questions for the diary (same as paper diary questions) were developed within a database and uploaded to the device to allow for unique questionnaire structure. Both questionnaires can be completed quickly, within 2 to 3 minutes, at home or … Put “M” when you take any medicine. Thus, the sleep diary used in the present study overlapped with the core consensus sleep diary [17, 18]. Yet, as noted in a previous consensus report,1 the collective impact of these studies has been limited by a lack of standardization in insomnia research methodologies. Organa integrates with the Consensus Sleep Diary On the other hand, researchers have not agreed on the format of the sleep diary.         quality of life, increased healthcare costs, and increased risks for serious For cases in which the group was divided about the optimal item wording, consensus was achieved through discussion. The Consensus Sleep Diary was the result of collaborations with insomnia experts and potential users. Abstract Objective The aim of the study was to put forward quantitative criteria for the Consensus Sleep Diary, to differentiate people with insomnia from normal sleepers. Resident Physician in Cardio-Thoracic and Vascular Surgery, Research Assistant Professor of Epidemiology. This lack of standardization, in turn, has contributed to inconsistencies in study findings that have hindered our ability to translate research findings into clinical practice. 0 REPLY.

For full access to this pdf, sign in to an existing account, or purchase an annual subscription. Recommendations regarding the CSD from the larger group of insomnia experts who attended the 2005 Pittsburgh Assessment Conference1 would also be captured. However, a variety of suggestions on how best to capture that information were given. METHODS. Despite the fact that sleep diaries are widely used in clinical and research settings, with few exceptions,23 almost no formal reliability and validity data have been presented. The proposed diary is intended as a living document which still needs to be tested, refined, and validated. A total of 47 individuals participated (14 good sleepers, 18 with insomnia, 14 with sleep apnea; 53% female; age 18-70 years). Consensus Sleep Diary-Core and-instructions. Of the 22 sleep diaries that were submitted, only 16 were unique, as some versions were in use across more than one site. This diary can be used for people who are awake or asleep at unusual times. (mean 2.6; SD = 0.55). Indeed, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has suggested that soliciting patient-reported outcomes (PROs) is an important piece in the development and validation of measures to be used in labeling studies.11 Thus, a consensus-based standardized sleep diary that is also informed by patient/user opinion could greatly advance the field. When asked about how to document other, more qualitative aspects of sleep, participants gave a wide variety of responses reflecting their individual experiences. The first author (CEC) then drafted a set of instructions for the diaries and circulated them for the other members to discuss in a subsequent teleconference on which the instructions were further revised to ensure they were sufficiently clear. Most importantly, participants expressed it was important to include some method for adding comments regarding important influences on a particular night of sleep. Although the CSD is unique in that it is the first diary to be developed with rigorous methodology for patient-reported outcome development, devising creative ways to evaluate the reliability and validity appropriately will be an important next step towards the goal of standardizing sleep diary assessment in insomnia research and practice. If your sleep or daytime functioning is affected by some unusual event (such as an illness, or an emergency) you may make brief notes on your diary. Insomnia is a very prevalent and significant sleep disorder associated with reduced 1 hour 10 min. This lack of standardization spilled over to some of the most basic tools used in insomnia research, such as the sleep diary. The workgroup then solicited copies of sleep diaries from all 25 members of the original Pittsburgh Assessment Conference. Following a scripted introduction explaining the purpose of sleep diaries, each focus group was asked a set of structured questions designed to elicit descriptions of sleep and daytime activities and events related to sleep. A number of participants suggested that numerical estimates would be only crude representations of their experience. Sample Sleep Diary.           contacting the first author. Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD) Permission for using the Consensus Sleep Diary is granted for not-for-profit use provided the diary is not altered and the original diary citation (Carney et al., 2012, below) is used. Three members did not respond to multiple contact attempts. 11:30 p.m. 3. Sleep Diary* 1 *Permission to use the Consensus Sleep Diary is restricted to clinical use only. This is not usually a problem. Write the date, day of the week, and type of day: Work, School, Day Off, or Vacation. Items deemed essential were included in a Core sleep diary… Put the letter “C” in the box when you have coffee, cola or tea. Finally, multiple participants advocated a more “visual” approach to quantification of sleep (clock faces, time lines) and requested simpler formats. The instructions for the additional questions in CSD-M also stipulate that the diary should be completed in the morning. The last question asked: (6) Was there something we missed? The CSD instructions included general information, such as what to do if the respondent misses recording on a particular day, and item-specific instructions to enhance likelihood of correct item interpretation.         psychiatric and medical comorbidities. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR PATIENT What is a Sleep Diary? In particular, they were asked how they would describe their sleep in quantitative terms (e.g., sleep timing, time to fall asleep, sleep amount, number and duration of awakenings) and qualitative terms (e.g., restfulness, impact of sleep on daytime function). How long did it take you to fall … Three versions of the final consensus sleep diary were created and are shown in Figures 1–3. What time did you get into bed? After considering these and other possibilities it was possible to reach consensus on core diary items, their format, and layout as manifested in the final version of the CSD. If possible, the sleep diary should be completed within one hour of getting out of bed in the Diagnosis was based on self-identification. The data were summarized into themes and changes to the drafts were made in response to the focus groups. Results showed that the CSD indices differentiated good sleepers from those with insomnia and were associated with similar objective …           industry or for-profit use can be obtained by Some advocated electronic formats, such as hand-held or desktop computer-based. Participants meeting Research Diagnostic Criteria for insomnia disorder (n=33) or normal sleepers (n=32) completed the Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD) and daily fatigue ratings for two weeks. 3_ How long did it take you to fall asleep? Sleep deprivation can contribute to moodiness, high blood pressure, poor concentration, the prolongation of mental illness, work difficulties, auto accidents, and more. Start a new sleep diary each week. A smaller subset of experts formed a committee and reviewed the compiled diaries. A draft of the Core and optional versions along with a feedback questionnaire were sent to members of the Pittsburgh Assessment Conference. Hierarchical linear modeling tested the within- and between-participant … The lexile analyses suggested that the Core diary instructions are at a sixth-grade reading level and the Core diary was written at a third-grade reading level.</p><p><b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>The Consensus Sleep Diary was the result of collaborations with insomnia experts and potential users. Keeping a sleep diary will let you learn about your sleep patterns and habits. Sleep diaries are easy to apply For example, one way of assessing reliability is to carry out diary assessments in the same individuals at two or more time points; this establishes test-retest reliability. The CSD would build upon sleep diaries previously used in insomnia research to facilitate comparisons across past and future studies.

Don’t worry too much about giving exact answers, an estimate will do. The Consensus Sleep Diary is the result of collaboration with insomnia These notes and summary comments were reviewed by the CSD workgroup along with an external consultant with expertise in focus group methodology (Dr. Kelly E. McShane), which resulted in a set of major themes. G ENERAL I NSTRUCTIONS FOR P ATIENT What is a Sleep Diary? It was agreed that the instructions needed to be explicit and written at or below an eighth-grade reading level. Use it to track your sleep patterns and improvements over time.           experts around the world to create the first standardized sleep diary. The Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD) is a standardized, prospective tool for tracking nightly subjective sleep. For instance, different participants emphasized elements such as the lightness or deepness of sleep, dream experiences, effects of physical symptoms and medications, and the influence of environmental and emotional factors on sleep. of hours slept … Consensus Sleep Diary All Instructions for the Sleep Diary are adapted from “The Consensus Sleep Diary: Standardizing prospective sleep self-monitoring” (Carney, C.E. In 2012 a coalition of insomnia researchers and other sleep experts developed a consensus sleep diary, which included endpoints other research found were most helpful for … In fact, multiple lab-specific sleep diaries have emerged, with response formats including numerical sleep/wake estimates, Likert ratings, and visual analogue scales. Previously developed diaries would be solicited from the insomnia research community, including Pittsburgh Assessment Conference members, and these diaries would be analyzed, compared, and discussed among the CSD Workgroup members to identify those items most commonly used and likely to be supported by the insomnia research community. Previous research on focus groups suggested that obtaining participant input via methods such as focus groups is a crucial component of developing patient reported outcomes (PRO).11,12 Focus groups were therefore conducted to evaluate the core and expanded CSD to ensure that the PRO items actually measured the constructs and phenomena relevant to the insomnia patient or subject. Over half (57%) approved of the CSD in its initial format. Sleep diaries from the original expert panel of 25 attendees of the Pittsburgh Assessment Conference1 were collected and reviewed. Participants reported that any brief quantitative summary was inadequate to describe their sleep experience, and that it was important to be able to describe their sleep experience in some detail. The subject will record what time they got into bed, time they went to sleep, how long to fall asleep, how many times they woke up, time they finally woke up, time they got out of bed, rate the quality of sleep… When asked how a sleep diary could best summarize quantitative aspects of their sleep, participants recommended sleep latency, sleep duration, and number and duration of awakenings. The word “day” means the time of day when you choose or must wake up. The Consensus Sleep Diary was the result of collaborations with insomnia experts and potential users. However, the prospective subjective perception of sleep in a sleep diary is a unique and valued perspective, and thus, might not necessarily be expected to agree with objective measures (e.g., PSG, actigraphy). The additional instructions indicate that all of the items are to be completed in the morning within one hour of getting out of bed. This diary can be used for people who are … The feedback from the group was integrated and the diary drafts were subjected to 6 focus groups composed of good sleepers, people with insomnia, and people with sleep apnea. The Consensus Sleep Diary was developed in 2012 by a collaboration of insomnia experts. Diaries are a crucial information-gathering tool. The specific aims of this work-group were to: (1) review the range and nature of sleep diaries previously used in insomnia research; (2) solicit diaries currently used from a large group of insomnia researchers; (3) identify commonalities in previously used sleep diaries and integrate those commonalities into a consensus instrument; (4) solicit critical input about the resultant consensus sleep diary from a wide range of insomnia researchers; (5) conduct qualitative field testing with patients to acquire additional information to be used for refining the diary instrument and its associated instructional set; and (6) conduct preliminary lexical analyses on the reading level required for the measure. Name. What time did you try to go to sleep? All groups were run at the University of Pittsburgh by master's level facilitators with experience in conducting focus groups for the development of PROs in the NIH-funded PROMIS Roadmap Initiative (U01 AR52155). In addition to the CSD and instructions, a questionnaire was also included. The Core Consensus Sleep Diary: The CSD (Figure 1) contained 9 items considered by the CSD workgroup and the 2005 conference participants to represent the most critical parameters. Record your sleep each morning. Despite the lack of a standardized format, the sleep diary has been regarded as the “gold standard” for subjective sleep assessment. If you forget to fill in the diary or are unable to finish it, leave the diary blank for that day. sleep onset latency (SOL), number of awakenings, sleep time or sleep efficiency,formation of a positive and clear association between the bed and sleeping, and improve-ment of sleep related psychological distress. The goal of the CSD focus groups was to solicit participant opinions regarding the optimal content, wording, and format (including the layout) of the CSD items. Sleep diaries have been universally used as the preferred method for collecting data over time on self-reported sleep and related function in insomnia research.1,9,10 However, the lack of standardization in diaries currently used in insomnia research studies has posed a significant impediment to progress in the field.1 The development of a Consensus Sleep Diary addressed this concern. Permission for The solicitation of sleep diaries versions from the 25 members of the original Pittsburgh Assessment Conference yielded replies from 22 members (88% response rate). The Expanded Consensus Sleep Diary for Morning:An expanded version of the CSD (Figure 2) included a number of optional items that could be completed in the morning upon arising (Optional morning completion items – CSD-M). The workgroup agreed to include guidelines for respondents within the diary itself to decrease the likelihood of common mistakes. A sleep diary is designed to gather information about your daily sleep pattern. In clinical and research settings, these more qualitative aspects of sleep and wakefulness may be captured by other more efficient methods such as specific patient-reported outcomes or clinical interviews. It would be helpful to have more exploration of the construct validity of the CSD. As previously agreed upon, the core CSD was formatted so that one week of nightly sleep data could be recorded on a single diary page. CONCLUSIONS: The Consensus Sleep Diary was the result of collaborations with insomnia experts and potential users. Thank you for submitting a comment on this article. © 2012 Associated Professional Sleep Societies, LLC. The consensus sleep diary project was an outgrowth of the 2005 Insomnia Assessment Conference which resulted in a publication with recommendations for standard research … Clinical prioritisation of revision knee surgical procedures: BASK working group consensus document. The proposed diary is intended as a living document which still needs to be tested, refined, and validated. The lexile analyses suggested that the Core diary instructions are at a sixth-grade reading level and the Core diary was written at a third-grade reading level. The Core CSD would be designed to fit on a single 8.5” × 11” page in landscape format, whereas the expanded CSD version would be designed to fit on the front and back sides of a single page. Links to all sleep diaries … Members were also permitted to suggest new wording if no choices were desirable. This diary can be used for people who are awake or asleep at unusual times. For the CSD-M instructions, mean sentence length was 12.3 words (SD 5.3, range 5-24), with a mean lexile Measure of 702 (SD 341, range 30-1440), corresponding to a mean fourth-grade reading level (range less than first grade to post-high school). The development of such a diary, however, faces a number of challenges. The term “bed” means the place where you usually sleep. 55 min. Another suggestion was to include direct estimate of TST as a Core rather than optional item; however the decision was made to derive this variable from other information in the diary, as recommended by Buysse et al.1. Sleep Diary* 1 *Permission to use the Consensus Sleep Diary is restricted to clinical use only. Carney CE et al. In summary, focus group participants clearly indicated agreement between the quantitative dimensions of sleep they considered to be important and those included in the diary. Additionally, the group agreed upon the method whereby items would be evaluated: The Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD) would be developed primarily for the purposes of insomnia research. In total, how long did these awakenings last? It also encourages clients to collect information about their caffeine intake, exercise, and mood, which can be used to explore relationships with sleep. The Pittsburgh Sleep Diary (PghSD) is an instrument with separate components to be completed at bedtime and waketime. The Consensus Sleep Diary helps you learn about your sleep patterns Abstract. Methods and Results: Sleep diaries from the original expert panel of 25 attendees of the Pittsburgh Assessment Conference1 were collected and reviewed.

Thus, these two versions have the same wording so only the CSD-M was examined. That is, they are completed at two different times; one version is completed entirely in the morning (CSD-M), and the other version has some items completed in the morning and other items that are completed before bed). In the sleep diary, the word “day” is the time when you choose or are required to be awake. The Expanded Consensus Sleep Diary for Evening: A third version of the CSD included the same items as CSD-M, but with instructions for morning and evening completion (Optional morning and evening completion – CSD-E; Figure 3).         of the assessment of insomnia (and other sleep disorders) for research and/or           to provide summary data and organized client sleep data that you can access at any time. One possibility is to focus on the validity of the diary. The proposed diary is intended as a living document which still needs to be tested, refined, and validated. Additional support from MH24652, AG00972, and AG26177 (DJB); AG08415, CA112035, UL1RR031980, the UCSD Stein Institute for Research on Aging and the Department of Veterans Affairs Center of Excellence for Stress and Mental Health (CESAMH) (SAI); MH67057, HL-073259 and Department of Veterans Affairs IIR-00-091 (JDE); AG14738 and DA13574 (KLL); and MH60413 and Canadian Institutes of Health Research MT42504 (CMM). The items were then entered into a self-report tabular format which was discussed on a subsequent teleconference. The CSD-M includes additional items about early (premature) morning awakenings (EMA), estimated total sleep time, Likert scale rating of the refreshing quality of sleep, napping/dozing, and alcohol, caffeine, and medication use. The reading level tool in Microsoft Office 2007 Word was used to determine the reading level. Colleen E. Carney, PhD, Daniel J. Buysse, MD, Sonia Ancoli-Israel, PhD, Jack D. Edinger, PhD, Andrew D.

Morin, PhD,  The Consensus Sleep Diary: Standardizing Prospective Sleep Self-Monitoring, Sleep, Volume 35, Issue 2, 1 February 2012, Pages 287–302, https://doi.org/10.5665/sleep.1642. To present an expert consensus, standardized, patient-informed sleep diary. Several participants suggested that the longest “solid” sleep period was an important quantitative aspect of sleep. One respondent requested the addition of an adherence item (e.g., whether the person was following a treatment recommendation such as stimulus control); however, it was decided not to include this item as it was only relevant for treatment trials. After	about	90	minutes	of	sleep, you	enter	a	sleep	state	called	“REM”	sleep, or	Rapid	Eye	Movement	sleep. The considerable diversity among the sleep diaries used in previous research suggests that there are many different points of view about: (1) the range of questions that should be included and how these questions should be worded; (2) how the diary should be formatted; (3) whether the sleep diary should elicit quantitative responses, qualitative responses, or both; (4) how common sleep parameters (SOL, WASO, SE) should be defined; (5) how much data should be acquired on a single sleep diary form (one day, one week, two weeks, etc. 11:30 p.m. 3. The core CSD as well as the expanded, optional version (later referred to as CSD-M) of the sleep diary and the instruction sets were both submitted to lexile analysis (http://www.lexile.com/analyzer/), which takes into account both the semantic (word frequency) and syntactic (sentence length) characteristics of the writing sample resulting in a lexile score corresponding to specific reading grade levels.18,19.
