Welcome to B&B RV we’re in denver colorado 8101 east 40th avenue just off i-70 today we’re going to walk around the delano uh it’s a thor product built on the mercedes chassis and we’ll go around the outside here and show you sorry this one still has a few bugs just got delivered we haven’t had time to get it washed up but we want to show you around it while we’ve got my famous cameraman here on the outside this first one is your propane this is uh something they’re gonna do for you at either a campground a truck stop u-haul someplace that sells propane they’ll fill that for you it’s not a self-serve thing this is the back of a furnace this is another big storage area so in our rental units you’re going to get a set of leveling blocks so when you park you need to get level for the fridge in these and so that’s what these blocks are in the back here just these wooden blocks and it’s actually three steps so you can just put this in front of whichever wheel is low so if the front’s low the back’s low the sides low put those boards in front of those slow wheels and just drive up one or two or three notches and we’ll have a level inside for you so you can you can see when you’re level without having to be outside or anything we’re going to include four camp chairs with all of our rentals so you’ll have camp chairs in these units this is the cable the cord so this cord is for electricity it’s going to come it’s going to plug in here and then it’s the other end is going to plug into the 30 amp outlet at the campground if you’re going to try to plug into a home outlet somewhere there is an adapter for that but you can only run certain things and the main thing that you cannot run if you’re not plugged into the 30 amp is the air conditioner it just doesn’t have enough power it’ll cause problems it’ll melt that in so if you’re camped at a campground you’re all fine if you’re trying to plug into a house somewhere a friend’s house while you’re staying you can’t run the air conditioner that way you would have to run the generator to get power for the air conditioner there’s a cable in here for cable tv if you’re going to do that at the campground and there’s a hose for your fresh water for refilling or hooking up to the water at the campground this one isn’t just an extra storage for you so you have all your keys on here for your different uh different locks this just houses the generator which all runs from inside the unit so you don’t need to access that while you’re out inside this compartment is your dump hose so your dump hose is stored there when you when your tanks get full you’re ready to dump you have two tanks you have a gray tank and a black tank the gray tank is your sinks and showers and the black tank is your toilet so you’re gonna take your hose out and you’re gonna take this cap off hook your hose on here put your hose into the ground in the drain and then on here this back one right here is your black tank and you’re just going to pull it straight out and let that black tank drain when it’s drained close it and be careful because if you’re running your generator that’s your generator exhaust and it’ll get real hot after you’ve closed your black tank this is your gray tank go ahead and pull that and let that grate the water from your sinks and shower it’s a little soapier rinse out that hose for you and then when you’re done close that take the hose off put it back in here and put the cap back on so you have on board water and you can use onboard water or you can just hook the hose up directly at the campground and use pressurized water and it’s okay to hook the hose up at the campground but you really don’t want to just hook up your dump hose and try to leave that hooked up it really doesn’t work you want to collect everything in your holding tanks and then dump it so in here you can hook up you’re going to hook up your hose to this side so hook up your water hose to this side and then you’ve got your um your drawings here so you know exactly what to do if you’re going to just use city pressurized water it’s here where it says city water so you can have one facing this way and one facing this way if you’re just gonna use the onboard water which they call dry camp you’re gonna have this one down and this one this way if you want to refill the onboard tank right here at tank fill and you’re gonna push this one down and this one over so really just look at the picture match the picture sanitize um that’s not gonna be you typically won’t need to do that so you’re just probably in while you’re out you’re going to use tank fill drag camp and city water so dry camp is where you’re going to use the water while you’re out and this one’s tank fill you’re gonna refill it when you use it all up and that’s all there is to the water in here this black one up here is a tank flush so your black tank has a sprayer in it if you hook up a hose here it’ll spray into that tank and rinse it out because in that black tank and the gray tank there’s just little screws that are the sensors to show how full the tank is and especially in that black tank toilet paper and such can hold up on those little sensor screws and it’ll show that there’s something in there when there’s not so you know i just dumped this thing and it says it’s the third fold but it’s something hanging up on that sensor and so that’ll rinse that tank out if you want to try that if you can hook up to cable tv in here it says sat for satellite that’s where you would hook up that cable and then on your tv tell it that you’re in the mode cable uh and in here there’s a water pump because you’ve got this little shower so if you need to rinse something off out here before you go back in and the water pumps off inside you can turn the water pump on here to get water out of your onboard tank and there’s a light it’s a light in here that’s also operated up there with the control panel so that’s the entire water on the back there is a ladder but this is emergency use only don’t get up on top unless you have an emergency it’s very very slippery when it’s wet little storage compartment for you here you’ll see down here there’s a quick release for gas connection primarily for when somebody buys the unit that can be hooked up to an outside grill but that can’t be just a typical household grill as being rv grill because they have different regulators on them that’s just your exhaust and your tire another big storage and then on the outside here we’ve got a couple of outlets so if you have this uh plugged into electricity or have the generator on then you have electricity and you’d have outlets that are hot here that you can plug things into out here on your patio side and so that’s the outside of the delano and we can go look at the inside so as you come into the entry door here you’re going to notice these two buttons on the bottom and the main power this one is your main battery disconnect you want this to be on at all times you want this red light to be on at all times and these are for stabilizer jacks on the rear side of the rv so it doesn’t rock so much these are not leveling jacks they’re stabilizer jacks so you can push this button and they’ll go down push it the other way obviously they’ll go up you just want to put these down to be firm on the ground so that the rv won’t rock back and forth while you’re walking around or if the wind’s blowing a little and it’s extremely important that with these jacks if you have these down and you start up the engine to go take off you’re going to bend them and they’re not going to come up and now you’re in a real pickle they won’t come up so make sure you pull these up before you start the engine and drive off and so just push up to go all the way up and they’re not to level this front to back or side to side they’re only to stabilize it so you only want to put those down to where they would be um touching you don’t want to kind of try to raise or lower anything with it and you have a switch for a step light here and this is just an inverter that you don’t need to do any changes on inside you’ll have or this is i’m sorry this we can edit that and this is your solar charger so this unit has a solar panel on the roof and this helps keep your batteries charged and tells you what your battery is as well as your control panel up above will tell you the status of your battery so this is the control panel on the inside of the delano on the mercedes chassis here you can see that you have a lot of different buttons this is your home button your lights you can turn on and off you can check your tanks fresh water gray tank black tank propane turn on your water pump turn on your tank heaters so your water pump you’re going to want to use if you’re using onboard water for anything shower toilet sink tank heaters are for winter use to keep the tanks from freezing but when you use those tank heaters they use quite a bit of electricity so you’ll want to be plugged into electricity or have the generator on when you’re using those tells you the levels of your batteries you can start and stop your generator and then you have separate buttons to use for individual things looking at the statistics on your generator your voltages your lights again all on or all off you can just turn them on right here and you can turn individual ones on too just one at a time cargo you probably don’t need on step well front awning exterior step so you have individual lights or master and this again is your uh cooling it’s a hot day here in denver today 103 in this thing as we came out to video you can set your temperature right here so um you know set that thing at 65 or 68 or wherever you feel comfortable while you’re using it this is the mode it’s on cool now you’ll see furnace down here below or auto so we’re on cool with the fan on high this is your slides so this has an awning for extend and retract if you use that awning which we recommend you don’t but if you use that awning do not leave the rv with that awning out make sure that awning is in any time you leave if a gust of wind comes up try to get it in because the wind will tear those off pretty easily this is your slide room so you’re going to just hit extend we’re going to go ahead and extend this slide while we’re sitting here so we can show you the rest of the rv and you just hold this button down this is a large slide so what they call a full wall slide the entire wall is sliding out your dinette wardrobe and storage in the middle your bed in the back and this is going to go all the way out the wall it’s a deep slide as you can tell by the depth of the dinette once this gets all the way out you can let go it’ll yeah you’ll see and hear it as it pushes up with the big rubber seal up against the wall it’s almost there now there you go that’s how long it takes to set up camp get that bed all the way out and um right below your control center is your sound system you can pair that to your phone so let’s start up here in the front and work our way to the back so the delano is built on the mercedes castle this is a diesel unit so you want to make sure you put diesel in it if you’re out using this it’s got the keys for it here just a lock and an unlock and keys for the compartments on the side the way to start this one is put your foot on the brake push the start engine and everything lights up and comes back to the base for your um gauges you’ve got a lot of the volume and cruise control on your steering wheel so mercedes has started to blend a little bit more together they’re commercial with their retail units and so instead of having a big transmission here now this is actually your transmission so you’ll see right here that you put this up for reverse in the middle for neutral and down for drive and you just push in the end for park so be sure you pay attention to that that’s that’s the whole transmission make sure you have your foot on the brake lights are here mirrors windows everything else is pretty standard it’s got the backup camera here in your mirror so you can always see what’s behind you um got the big radio and uh information here we don’t have these hooked up to um to any any um gps so the gps you can use on your phone and everything else is fairly standard up here oh the one thing that is a little different on these units is on the side of the seat there’s a lumbar adjustment and this little cushion can adjust in the front but the main adjustment for your seats are here you can see there’s three memory settings but then you know you can change it back change it forward and backward but the buttons for your seat are here on the door not on the seat otherwise that’s pretty standard up here you got your lights let’s turn this back off get here where i can reach up above so this cushion fits into this hole here to make your bed and there’s a ladder to go up to get up and down and of course you’ve got a shade up there on the front you’ve got windows on each side we have the curtains on those right now so when you put this away just make sure you don’t shove it up too hard but shove it up enough and make sure this ladder is secure so it’s not going to come flying back as you drive we keep the remotes for your television here television’s right up here on this one remotes are here you got some charging uh stations there so this is upgraded to uh what’s called the dream dinette there’s no leg underneath it just has a hydraulic arm on the wall there so there’s this lock right here this little lever will loosen this and allow this to just slide down so you’re going to slide this all the way down to these two rails on each side so you just move this cushion out of the way slide it down to here and then you’re going to lift it back up when you’re done and lock this make sure you lock that so that it just stays up for you these cushions here will lay in the middle when you’re making this a bed so this cushion and this cushion these will lift up to extend i’m not a big fan of these i wouldn’t put a lot of weight on that so when you lift this up it can extend this out a little further but be careful how much weight you’re putting on that got storage up above these units can have a flyswatter and a lighter and matches and a manual we write our own manuals for these anything and everything in here is covered in the manual so if you have any issues while you’re out we try to make that easy we do it on paper still because you’re off and out where you don’t have access to get on to driver and internet or any kind of video just more storage above the kitchen the sink storage under the kitchen microwave another drawer for storage this is your cooktop so your two burners are here your fridge in this one has a mode setting and uh oops got to turn it on first to get to the mode so this is your on and off this one now says mode automatic and you want to leave that in automatic mode right now it’s showing that it’s using electricity because we have the generator running so it’s using electricity anytime you’re plugged into electricity you have the generator on this will be running on electricity when you shut that off or unplug it it’s automatically going to switch back to gas i would just leave this on automatic and it’ll switch back and forth if this green light is not on that you just want to make sure what’s going on turn it off turn it back on it’ll typically start up right away by doing that and there’s the cold temperature again this time here you’re going to want to have it turned all the way up but if it’s too cold you just press this for one two three four and five so uh the freezer is on top and the fridge down here and uh this will be on for you before you come and pick up your rv for rentals it’ll all be cold ready for you to put food into your bathroom is in here we include a a little bucket with some cleaning supplies for you in a small broom there’s a trash can for you your toilet is called a foot flush so you’re just going to press this pedal with your foot you can see how that opens if you’re hooked up to water or have the water pump on it’s going to flush for you and it’ll flush just as long as you hold that down and you can close the lid under here just more storage this is where we’re going to have toilet paper and chemical for you in a rental and on this unit uh the water heater is controls are right here um it’s gonna sometimes look to you like it’s on because this red light is on um actually that’s not on so you want to turn it on and it’ll all light up and this green light will come on this is just to change from centigrade to fahrenheit we’re just going to have it at fahrenheit you can see it’s a little warm in here today 118. um but or no i’m sorry this is the hot water so yeah the hot water would be about 118 is what we recommend that you leave that on and i think the inside of the coach is about 118 as well turn it back off you just press the button again turn it off there is an outlet in here any outlet that’s by a water source has to be a g gci a ground fault interrupt and just push the center of that if somehow that gets tripped you’re just going to reset those if for some reason the outlet in the bathroom and probably in the kitchen doesn’t work it just needs to be reset this one also has a fan up here that you can run with the switch here too i can just open it manually to exhaust turn that off you got the light switch in here that you can control with that or with your main light switch out there this one has a lot of storage here in the middle you got the wardrobe it’s very deep as you can see it’s got a bar and a closet with some adjustable shelving and then three big drawers down below this one has a fold up bed which allows us to have the entire room slide in and out so this bed is held up with this cord here so you just drop this bed down when you’re ready and this is a full queen bed in the back operational windows around a couple of plugins off to the side here and another tv in the back and you also have the panel here for your controls for your lights back here and on the back here this control panel um is your lights master lights on and off and your bedroom lights and your ceiling lights for the middle so that when you come to bed you can shut off all the lights back here there is an overhead fan back here for just more exhaust and then when you go ahead and put this bed up you want to really make sure that you uh you put this bungee in here and it just flips right in behind this little clip that’ll keep this bed up because when you slide this in you don’t want that bed excuse me flopping in and out against the wall so i have a fan here a fan here i have another fan in the bathroom for exhaust and um this is our delano it’s 24 foot long made on a
