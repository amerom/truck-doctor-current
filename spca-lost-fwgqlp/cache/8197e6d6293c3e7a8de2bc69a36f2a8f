It has also been suggested that the costs associated with accreditation may pay for themselves in the form of decreased liability costs and increased marketing effects (Nicklin & Dickson, 2009). Until recently, there was no national accreditation program for public health departments. Resident behavior and facility practices deficiency citations (incident-rate ratios [95% CI]), Quality of life deficiency citations (incident-rate ratios [95% CI]), Quality of care deficiency citations (incident-rate ratios [95% CI]), J, K, or L deficiency citations (AOR [95% CI]), TJC accreditation (comparing 1 year prior to accreditation and year of accreditation), TJC accreditation (comparing year of accreditation with first year after), TJC accreditation (comparing deficiency citations over time), Copyright © 2020 The Gerontological Society of America. Similarly, a more current analysis of accreditation’s impact on nursing homes is warranted, as survey methods and standards continue to evolve (Menachemi, Chukmaitov, Brown, Saunders, & Brooks, 2008; Wachter, 2004). Statistically significant at p = .05 level or better. Examining the impact of accreditation is important, as many resources are expended in preparation for surveys. Some of the key benefits are highlighted below: International recognition. Similarly, our findings that accredited nursing homes tend to have lower Medicaid resident occupancy but higher overall occupancy rates suggest that accredited facilities have a more financially favorable mix of residents. Negative binomial regression is based on a generalization of the Poisson distribution that can account for the skewed nature of data (i.e., data overdispersion). Voluntary Accreditation is a concept of self-regulation which focuses on self-study and evaluation and on the continuing improvement of educational quality. Physician leadership and involvement are critically important to the success of patient safety improvement and the accreditation process (TJC, 2011e). Washington, DC: Author. Quality of care in U.S. nursing homes continues to be a cause for concern. The four categories of deficiency citations used as dependent variables are listed and defined in Table 1. Strengthening Applied Epidemiology in West Africa: Progress, Gaps, and Advancing a Regional Strategy to Improve Health Security. Linking to a non-federal website does not constitute an endorsement by CDC or any of its employees of the sponsors or the information and products presented on the website. Accredited arrangements are confirmed by the Australian Government as applying best practice and being of a high standard. Two studies by Lau and colleagues noted that TJC-accredited nursing homes had fewer inappropriate medication prescriptions (Lau, Kasper, Potter, & Lyles, 2004; Lau, Kasper, Potter, Lyles, & Bennett, 2005). Thus, the Huber–White sandwich estimator, clustered by market (i.e., the county), was used for all the multivariate analyses (Zeger & Liang, 1992). ), Nonprofit Clubs: Voluntary Regulation of Nonprofit and Comparing citations in the year of accreditation with the first year after accreditation, 3 of the 4 deficiency categories were significant. This is shown in Table 1. Indeed, measuring outcomes should not be limited to a single factor or dimension, as outcomes in older adults are frequently affected by the complex multidimensionality of their physical, psychological, and social challenges (Berkman, 2011). In 2007, nearly 18% of nursing homes were cited for serious deficiencies that place residents at risk for severe injury or death (General Accounting Office, 2008). Our results are somewhat consistent with some of the hospital accreditation literature; although we note that findings in this area vary in that the impact of hospital accreditation appears to vary depending on the quality measures studied (Chen, Rathore, Radford, & Krumholz, 2003; Landon et al., 2006; Lutfiyya, Sikka, Mehta, & Lipsky, 2009; Miller et al., 2005). Federal and state surveyors conduct on-site inspections of nursing homes to assess compliance with these standards for quality. © The Author 2011. Staffing characteristics are often regarded as highly influential when examining quality (Castle & Ferguson, 2010); thus, several staffing characteristic variables are included. Results for all analyses are reported using the Huber–White sandwich estimator. Part 1: BENEFITS OF VOLUNTARY ACCREDITATION Discuss the benefits of a health care organization going through voluntary accreditation such as JCAHO. Medicaid reimbursement levels came from primary data collected by the authors. Robust SEs, clustered by county, are given in parentheses. The sum of each facility's squared percentage share of beds in the county for all facilities in the county (0–1). We identified higher staffing levels in TJC-accredited nursing homes of medical directors, physician extenders, and top management compared with nonaccredited facilities. In the fourth analysis, we examine the difference scores in the deficiency citations using information across time (from 2002 to 2010), wherein the scores for each year of accreditation are compared with subsequent scores 1 year later. Descriptive statistics (Ms and SDs) for the deficiency citations and for the staffing, facility, and market variables (Ms, SDs, and percents) of interest are presented. As a process, it is a form of peer review in which an association of schools and colleges establishes sets of criteria and procedures. CDC is not responsible for Section 508 compliance (accessibility) on other federal or private website. Herfindahl index. Further research on alternative approaches to voluntary accreditation that are less resource and financially intensive than TJC is needed. Implications:  Our results indicate that TJC-accredited nursing homes improve their quality immediately after accreditation and continue to maintain these improvements over the long-term. However, very little is known about nursing homes that are accredited by this body. Accreditation is best viewed as an ongoing process of agency-wide improvement and development through which an agency or program strives for excellence. In general, there is a need for more research regarding the impacts of accreditation on quality in nonhospital settings, such as nursing homes. Although not a new approach, voluntary accreditation has so far received limited attention in the United States as a way to improve nursing home quality. Pressure ulcers and falls are two nursing sensitive care measures that have been included in the 2011 Joint Commission Patient Safety Goals (TJC, 2010d, 2011c). Lastly, we found no difference in the overall nurse staffing levels between TJC-accredited and nonaccredited facilities, consistent with a previous study of accredited nursing homes (Kern, 2002). In the accrediting process, the performance of educational units is measured against national standards. Most notably, TJC-accredited nursing homes had fewer deficiency citations in all four categories examined (i.e., resident behavior and facility practices deficiency citations, quality of life deficiency citations, quality of care deficiency citations, and J, K, or L deficiency citations). FTE RNs per 100 residents (including only full-time workers, excluding part-time and contract staff), FTE RNs per 100 residents (including only part-time workers, excluding full-time and contract staff), FTE LPNs per 100 residents (including only full-time workers, excluding part-time and contract staff), FTE LPNs per 100 residents (including part-time workers, excluding full-time and contract staff), FTE NAs per 100 residents (including only full-time workers, excluding part-time and contract staff), FTE NAs per 100 residents (including part-time workers, excluding full-time and contract staff), Ratio of RNs to NAs plus LPNs (i.e., RN/(NA + LPNs), FTE top management (including nursing home administrator and director of nursing) per 100 residents, FTE physician extenders per 100 residents. For example, TJC-accredited nursing homes were associated with fewer quality of care deficiency citations the longer they are accredited (AOR = 0.92; p ≤ .001). Consider how voluntary accreditation can reduce liability issues in the health care organization.. …AND NO. These findings regarding weak physician involvement are potentially concerning. Since September 2011, the Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB) has recognized health departments that meet national standards that ensure they provide essential public health services in their communities. These data include almost all nursing homes in the United States, consisting of about 17,000 facilities. TJC is by far the dominant accrediting body of health care organizations in the United States ( Griffith, Knutzen, & Alexander, 2002 ). The ability of TJC-accredited nursing homes to sustain improvements in quality over the long-term may relate to TJC’s emphasis on continuous performance improvement as a core function of their accreditation program. First, the cross-sectional association of TJC accreditation and deficiency citations is examined using the 2010 data. These findings support the need for further discussion and facilitation of voluntary accreditation in nursing homes. Thus, it would appear that TJC-accredited nursing homes continue to improve their quality the longer they are accredited (see Table 2). Although they do not appear to have more nursing staff per resident, these TJC-accredited nursing homes tend to have more permanent employees and fewer contract staff (Kern, 2002). The ... benefits of engaging in accreditation and related efforts — benefits that the national program is designed to achieve (e.g., quality and performance improvement, doi:10.1377/hlthaff.w4.534, Advancing nursing home quality through quality improvement itself, The quest for nursing home quality: Learning history's lessons, An overview of methods for the analysis of longitudinal data. Cambridge University Press, pp. Accredited facilities did significantly differ (p ≤ .05) from national averages for facility characteristics reported in OSCAR data. The benefits of proficiency testing are widely recognized. Facility characteristics (i.e., bed size, ownership, chain membership, occupancy, Medicaid occupancy, and number of residents with limitations in activities of daily living [ADLs]) were identified from the OSCAR. voluntary accreditation of state, territorial, tribal and local governmental public health departments. Using our Accreditation Handbook of Standards, the organization performs a self-evaluation. In M. K. Gugerty, & A. Prakash (Eds. Using the percentile distribution of deficiency citations within each state gives a more consistent comparison of deficiency citations across states. Program Wide Improvement: The Benefits of Accreditation OSCAR is a data source maintained by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in cooperation with state long-term care surveying agencies. Comparing staffing levels in the online survey certification and reporting (OSCAR) system with the Medicaid cost report data: Are differences systematic? 4 | What is accreditation? Accredited sites surveyed agreed or strongly agreed that accreditation yielded benefits, including Stimulating quality and performance improvement (98%) Creating greater accountability and transparency (92%) Improving management processes (90%) Accreditation standards are derived primarily from the Florida Model Jail Standards. A list of nursing homes that are currently TJC accredited was produced through a web search of the TJC quality check website (http://www.qualitycheck.org/) in July 2010. Nursing homes must comply with the requirements of federal regulations in order to receive payment under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Active for the past 100 years, this private, voluntary system of self-examination and peer review has been central to the creation of a U.S. higher education enterprise that is outstanding in many respects. Therefore, there is an expected negative association between chain membership and receipt of deficiency citations. TJC is a private, not-for-profit organization that accredits health care organizations and programs, including more than 4,000 hospitals, 5,000 home care organizations, and over 1,000 long-term care facilities (TJC, 2011a). Accreditation has been a voluntary process through which the organization is able to measure the quality of its services and performance against nationally or internationally recognized standards. Although aggregate nurse staffing levels may not be higher in TJC-accredited nursing homes, we speculate that the use of more full-time staff may play an important role for nurses and nurse managers in the accreditation process. Higher values indicate a less competitive market. Accreditation is used in both the regulated and voluntary sectors. The present study seeks to determine whether the likelihood of receiving deficiency citations changes following nursing home TJC accreditation. Accreditation provides an assurance of quality to students, parents, and the public. Different approaches, beyond traditional regulation and inspection are needed. “Accreditation” is the primary means of assuring and improving the quality of higher education institutions and programs in the United States. The benefits of a health care organization being accredited by JCAHO will provide external These characteristics are considered to be accurate and reliable (Kash et al., 2007). The process is designed to accommodate all facilities, from the smallest to the largest. Such shortfalls have been partly attributed to inadequate assessments for potentially dangerous conditions at critical points in resident care (Scott-Cawiezell & Vogelsmeier, 2006). Based on the potential benefits of accreditation described in the literature and taking all covariates described above into account, we hypothesize that TJC-accredited nursing homes will experience a reduced likelihood of receiving deficiency citations. A 2002 study by LTQ Inc. found that TJC-accredited nursing homes had fewer care-related deficiency citations, fewer life safety code deficiency citations, and fewer deficiency citations involving immediate jeopardy to residents (Kern, 2002; TJC, 2010a). It is a process of recognizing and assessing agencies and programs against accepted standards of performance, integrity, and quality. Recent reviews examining the broad scale benefits of accreditation remain largely inconclusive (Greenfield & Braithwaite, 2008; Mays, 2004; Nicklin & Dickson, 2009). Deficiency citations are issued when a facility does not meet a standard for certification and regulatory sanctions can be issued if these citations are severe.
