It's a great motorway cruiser which is 75% of my off peak commute and it handles London's pot-holed and speed bump infested side streets very well. Love the comfort, handling and power from the diesel engine. Had a tow bar fitted by KIA and now afraid to use due to having to keep in much lower gears  on inclines already. It drives well, is nice inside and made from good quality materials. Also - very well made. 2017 models can only use hands-free Bluetooth if a USB charging cable is connected and I find this annoying. Less than 6 months old just about to get its third clutch ( oil seal leak contaminating the clutch causing a shudder). Kia loads its cars with plenty of equipment as standard, and my Sportage has plenty of toys that Iâm looking forward to playing with. The latest review of Kia Sportage measures performance, economy, comfort, practicality and reliability. We picked up our new Kia after having 11-and-a-half months of absolute pain and horror with our Haval H6 Lux. Surprising amount of pull but the steering at motorway speed is poor. I call Kia in Reading, explain the problem and am told I have to wait a week to be seen if I don’t want a courtesy car and 3 weeks if I do. On the plus side very roomy for kids, luggage and things like 5ft fish tanks! With the ISG enabled, the start and stop of the engine feels rather abrupt. The Kia Sportage proves that sometimes perseverance pays off. The car stalled whilst pulling out onto a junction and went into limp home mode. Terrific SUV! Stepping up from a 2014 model I am most pleased with the leap forward in the refinement of ride. I’ve found that the warranty really isn’t as great as it sounds. A lot more refined, smoother and quieter. Now the clutch judder has returned, too. I wouldn't recommend buying this for performance. i needed something with better ground clearance than the Focus, as our road generally floods a little after a good downpour. I am very pleased with my acquisition as I read a lot of reviews on the internet before buying it and I knew what to except (for example a higher fuel consumption than its competitors). Our reviews, powered by Feefo will help you decide what Kia is right for you. The car doesn’t make it to Kia as whilst on route I can’t engage any of the gears. No complaints about bumps or the road deterring the steering much. Computer showed 6.4 litres per hundred which seemed to tally with kilometres covered... We have been looking for a replacement for our 11 year old Magna which has served us well. Not a performance car at all. Poor customer service and disinterested dealers means the 7 year wanrranty isn’t worth the paper it was written on. Turbo replaced but lagging remained. I have found and so have others that the radio information isn't readily available. The running costs of the car are high and barely 3 months go by without something needing fixing or replacing. Wanted something else other than a sedan but didnt want a big SUV so settled on the Sportage. Love the driving position, mpg is not great but has improved as the engine beds in. Great car - so much better than the last one. Everything is in the right place. I feel very, very let down. I would advise take the service pack as this will be inflation proof over the yearly increased costs and they give you a courtesy car for free. Moral - don't get a dual clutch transmission from Kia. Having pulled the vehicle over and switched off and on again the system seemed to reset itself without further problems but then the MPG was reduced to 28mpg whilst not towing. Surprisingly comfy and rides surprisingly well. Heavy on tyres and the auto version is expensive on the road tax. Gave it 500 miles running in period and tried various fuel providers Shell, Gulf, Esso and supermarket fuels.  View all 54 consumer vehicle reviews for the 2020 Kia Sportage on Edmunds, or submit your own review of the 2020 Sportage. Be very wary. 2020 Kia Sportage Reviews: Read 3 candid owner reviews for the 2020 Kia Sportage. £290 of non-warranty repairs were identified including a faulty front passenger side electric window. I can't fault it one bit. The redesigned Sportage is a stylish and mildly sporty choice among small SUVs. Service 2 (£220) and MOT Recommended List Price (MRLP) inclusive of GST, exclusive of options and on road costs. Everything else has worked perfectly. Even if it were the AWD with turbo, it's not something you drive for excitement. Parking sensors on the front have to be turned on manually when you want to use them, they are not on automatically at low speed. It happily pulls from 30mph in 6th. The long list of features on the Platinum series has impressed everybody who has seen the vehicle. Cannot afford not to have breakdown insurance? A technician came out and over a distance of 15 miles I achieved 41 MPG. Of all the available SUVs at the time in my $30–35K price range, the Sportage in my eyes was the best-looking creature by far... Having had the Sportage for a few weeks I am, so far, very impressed with the value for money it offers. Lagging with this transmission type seems typical. The obvious stuff is the folding rear seats, which Iâm hoping give me enough boot space to hold my bike and associated accessories, â¦ Our Sportage is now 6 weeks old and travelled 1400 klm's and as to be expected has not missed a beat. Speed awareness course: all you need to know, Copyright © Dennis Publishing Limited 2020. Kia dealership have admitted they have received other complaints and the manufacturers are also aware but nothing as yet done about it. Very good economically. Introduction. This is by far the worst car for driving experience. Wish me well with the manual. 4 out of 5 stars. Brakes, Electrics, Engine, Gearbox / clutch. The stop start works occasionally. Major upgrade over the previous model, better interior, quietness and ride and fully loaded with bells and whistles, shame this is spoilt by endless rattles in the rear of the cabin and an auto gearbox that seems to hang on to 4th and 5th gear far to long and is not as smooth as it should be. Sport mode makes a great difference to performance but the button is poorly placed in my opinion (low on the centre console) it would be better being switched on when moving the gear lever sideways into manual mode. I have been told everything is fine. Tows well when everything is working but you wont get that throbbing exhilarating feeling at any point other than when the transmission runs away with you. Just after 38 miles on clock, had rear parking brake problems. The road noise is very very low and the controls and build quality are high. Amazing car. I bought my Kia Sportage GT in nov 2016, every option except ACC. 2012 Kia Sportage Platinum SL. Unless otherwise stated, all prices are shown as Manufacturer's We were first attracted to Kia because of the 7 year warranty and sold on it by the finish inside and out... Bought the Kia Sportage platinum diesel and have now had 2 years of trouble free motoring. The engine is now much quieter, the steering improved and the way the suspension handles my everyday route shows up my 2014 model's shortcoming. Improvements over the previous model are well worthwhile. Our most recent reviewer s said: Bought car for long warranty and easy driving. One to watch, but still superb car, with 7 years warranty, you cannot go wrong. With the aggressive stance and sporty nose, it's a welcoming package, though a bit misleading. A mid-life facelift for Kiaâs best-selling car in the UK. The old reversing camera system was 100% better with much higher video definition on the monitor screen. The infotainment system feels a bit limited compared to my previous Honda CRV, though. More about Feefo: Feefo are a reviews provider, committed to collecting real customer feedback on behalf of the businesses they work with. Do you own the Kia Sportage? If you've driven a sedan, you've driven this Sportage. A big disappointment, however, is there is no CD player or hard drive for your music. Clutch judder meant the clutch had to be replaced at 19k, it gets brake judder when braking, which is most noticeable when on motorway which is where I spend most of my time. Otherwise ... nice car when working. 5. High tech car and well built, up there with Audi and BMW. (2016 models did not need to be cable connected). May be due to the bigger alloys on the higher spec models. Firstly after a few visits the software of ECU needed upgrading and then the EGR was found faulty and seized. The steering on a straight road will not hold centre so you are constantly correcting from left to right. Both of which were made clear at the time of the purchase. I've had extensive experience with a few different vehicles and this one rates as just above average... yet, I still get a tinge of excitement to take it out. This is not a good idea. As another reviewer said my car felt better after the garage had it up on the ramp for several hours but they say they didn't do anything just checked it over! The mpg for the first 3500 miles was 49mpg which I was pleased with, since then I have done the same sort of motoring but now average 38 over the last 3500 mile, now covered 7000 miles. There have been a lot of independent reviews from media throughout New Zealand, and the world, about whatâs good with the 2019 Kia Sportage, and whatâs not. Boot size isn't anything impressive, but sufficient. Very seduced. Having got everything sorted I thought the problem would be resolved but the lagging remained. The Kia Sportage is a handsome, reliable and well-thought-out car. May be fine for you but suggest you do a motorway test drive first. It has built itself as a â¦ Commendable work to Kia and Peter Schreyer. The affordable price (£12k), reasonable mileage 35k, and the remaining 4 years of Kia’s 7 year warranty left, meant that a 3 year old diesel Sportage was the perfect fit. Average owner rating: 3.5 out of 5 3. I have had this vehicle since February and taken back to suppliers 9 times in connection with lagging from a standstill and being very revvy when changing through gears to a point where the transmission has a mind of its own and seems to move when it decides to do so and not when the driver decides. At 9000 miles the front shock top mounts have worn and need replacing, all of this without having reached 10000 miles yet. Driven carefully I just got 43.6mpg on a 51 mile run so I'm quite pleased with fuel economy though over the winter I was only averaging about 34mpg on lots of short trips. For the most part, Kia and Hyundai have a fairly solid reputation for their reliability. Personally I cannot get fully comfortable,  there is not enough adjustment on the reach/rake. The Platinum version's interior comfort compares easily to that of an Audi or BMW. Not sure what the fuss is all about, the car literally uses no petrol. Crunching gears: Gears 2 and 4 were difficult to engage. I experienced the rear brake callipers sticking ( 1 very hot wheel) after only 250 miles. It is the plug from the short phase and I believe it only affects cars with xenon headlights. Customer services were first class though but cant make a silk purse out of a sows ear. After 3 days, I’m told the clutch has failed and there are further advisories such as tyres and brakes that weren’t highlighted at the service. It's low and mild in comparison. We have 7 owner reviews for the latest Kia Sportage: Sort by: Kia Sportage (2016 onwards) Owner Reviews (7 owner reviews) Average owner rating: 4.3 out of 5 4. The 1.7 L diesel does not consume fuel, ever, it seems. We’ve always liked the look of the Sportage. Contrary to claims the average mpg could not be improved from about 37mpg regardless of how well I drove it. 'Own.' Whilst towing a caravan the downhill brake light came on at a roundabout together with anti skid light followed by a bang under the hood and limp mode restricted to 3000 revs. Loss of power - worse in cold weather: after initially saying there was nothing wrong with it the Kia Garage told us that the battery needed replacing,  this wasn’t under warranty and would cost £300.
