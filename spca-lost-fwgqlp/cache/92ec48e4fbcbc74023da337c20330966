</body></html>";s:4:"text";s:10500:"Over the past few years, hospitals, outpatient centers, clinics, and private practices have enlisted the services of nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) to fill some of the gap. Nurse Practitioners (NP) and Physician Assistants (PA) are advanced healthcare professionals found in many health organizations. More than 80 percent of NPs train in primary care. This is especially true in gastroenterology, but I think there is a role for a PA or NP in every specialty. There are nearly 200,000 nurse practitioners (NPs) practicing in the US, and The American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP) has made it an annual tradition to recognize and bring awareness to the incredible work these providers do by celebrating National Nurse Practitioner Week.One Medical is proud to have many NPs practicing in our offices throughout the country.

They may also specialize in different categories. As a gastroenterologist, a PA or NP can see a lot of patients in clinic, enabling me to shift my time to be more procedure-heavy. If you had to be a member of the healthcare team other than a PA, what would you choose? With a focus on health promotion, disease prevention, and health education and counseling, nurse practitioners guide patients in making smarter health and lifestyle choices, which can improve overall quality of life. I didn’t necessarily choose PA for the “lateral mobility” that many hopeful PAs will enthusiastically claim as their reason for not becoming a physician. Both nurse practitioners and physician assistants have advanced medical training (usually a master’s degree) and are qualified to examine patients and prescribe medications. The last thread on this topic was back in May, it was about 9 posts long and was mostly about applying to PA programs (generalization). There are a few states that allow totally independent practice for NPs also, otherwise the actual jobs differ very little (mostly in terms of speciality areas more than anything else). According to the American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANPs), there are over 222,000 licensed nurse practitioners in the US as of 2016. In this episode, Matt talks about his journey, why he chose to be an NP, and why now he’s choosing to go to medical school. Physician assistants are more likely to go into a surgical specialty, for example, while nurse practitioners may focus on areas like adult-gerontology, pediatrics, or women’s health. In other states, PAs can prescribe medication while NPs cannot. In these states, working as a physician assistant would offer you greater opportunity.

The difference between Physician Assistant vs. Nurse Practioner lies primarily in the nature of their education and their role in various medical specialties. People who choose a nurse practitioner for primary care tend to have lower out-of-pocket costs, fewer emergency room visits, shorter hospital stays and lower medication costs. Another difference is ease of access. Nurse Practitioners Provide Higher Quality Care . At first glance, determining the differences between the occupations might not be clear. “Ultimately, whether you aspire to be an NP, PA, MD or DO, remember this: whichever healthcare path you choose, your priority must always be to provide the highest level of patient care.” In recent years, however, NPs and PAs have taken on more autonomy and responsibility as many doctors have moved toward specialties and hospital employment.
