ABIM hopes to roll out assessment options specific to malignant or classical hematology within the next couple of years.2 While the longitudinal assessment option was advocated for and applauded by ASH as well as individual practitioners and other organizations that represent them, there is considerable confusion about how the changes will affect hematologists.3. Medical Calculators; Search Features; Graphics Search; Feedback to Editors; Practice Changing UpDates; Drugs & Drug Interaction; Table of Contents; Patient Education; Content Sharing; What's New; How to Access UpToDate; Earning CME/CE/CPD Credit. Practice Assessment and Patient Safety points still … The KCI option also relieves some of the pressure on physicians taking the test. Access will continue to expand to other specialty assessments through 2018 and 2019. Tips for all physicians taking the traditional MOC exam Take the exam tutorial to practice using UpToDate ® and become comfortable with the interface. Welcome! In the future, ABIM will continue to explore incorporating additional resources into MOC assessments." For example, when you see the term “pill-rolling tremor,” your mind makes the association with Parkinson’s disease, but the correct answer may be about something quite different. “ABIM is striving to underscore the value of the different maintenance of certification aspects and tries to support physicians staying up to date,” said Beth Faiman, PhD, CNP, from the Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders at Cleveland Clinic and Associate Editor of ASH Clinical News. ABIM to Develop Longitudinal Assessment Option. We at ABIM have been hearing that you wanted alternatives to a once-every-10-years daunting exam experience, and we have been working with many of you to deliver something different. They want feedback that provides resources to enhance their knowledge if the test reveals any gaps. “Another was to recognize that physicians, as they move through their practices through the course of their career, tend to focus in certain areas and some specialties. It's integrated with the same steamlined online platform that UpToDate physicans use to accrue and redeem CME. Benefits of UpToDate CME for ABIM MOC: Earn ABIM MOC points-eligible CME at the point-of-care; Increase opportunity for professional developement ; Save time, mont and resources; UpToDate topics are … Those taking the longitudinal assessment will be able to use “any external resource – other than another doctor – that the physician has access to,” such as journal articles, said Dr. Battaglia. Still, Dr. Zumberg explained, physicians want different ways to engage with MOC and keep their knowledge current. UpToDate will first be incorporated into ABIM's Internal Medicine and Nephrology Knowledge Check-Ins and Internal Medicine and Nephrology traditional MOC exams in 2018. Responding to this criticism, ABIM President and CEO Richard Baron, MD, admitted that the organization had “overreached,” and ABIM dropped the practice assessment and quality-improvement plan requirement but kept the 100 MOC point requirement. Clinicians can use credits earned from use of UpToDate to fulfill ABIM MOC requirements. Dr. Zumberg took the 2-year hematology KCI in 2019 and appreciated not only the ability to use UpToDate, but also the fact that his test results came immediately. They’re still using MedStudy products to prepare for the exam, like flashcards, review courses and our Core textbook. The 10-year MOC secure exam in hematology is offered twice per year, must be taken at a special testing center, currently costs $1,200, and takes about 10 hours to complete. ABIM currently still requires physicians to earn 100 MOC points every 5 years to maintain certification, through a variety of continuing medical education or quality-improvement activities. She attempted the KCI in the spring of 2020 and failed. That same year, the task force released its report, and, Dr. Battaglia told ASH Clinical News, “that report was fairly clear in terms of its recommendations.” Chief among these “was to move away from sole reliance on the 10-year MOC exam,” he said. “Developing a longitudinal assessment option is part of our ongoing evolution at ABIM,” the organization said in its announcement. This spring, more than 750 physicians took the Knowledge Check-In (KCI) to meet their assessment requirement of ABIM’s Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program. But, due to the breadth of discipline, it isn’t a great resource to prepare for the KCI. Because many practices have UpToDate subscriptions, doctors who took the KCI exam felt like it was more relevant to their clinical practice than the 10-year exam–but there’s still a lot of progress to be made in regards to making exams be applicable to practice. On the ABIM website, it states: "The exams are given in modular format with a maximum of 60 multiple-choice questions per exam session.
