The only difference between a weir and a barrage is of gates, that is the flow in barrage is regulated by gates and that in weirs, by its crest height. The only difference between a weir and a barrage is of gates, that is the flow in barrage is regulated by gates and that in weirs, by its crest height. Canal head regulator. In most cases, it is built to control water flow, measure the discharge, prevent flooding, and make rivers navigable. River training works. Weir is a obstruction in the river course to raise the water level on upstream side. Noun ()An adjustable dam placed across a river to regulate the flow of water downstream. the barrage or weir generally extending beyond the main structure to separate the under sluices, river sluices and spillways into independent units for facilitating regulation. On the other hand, a barrage is a concrete structure that consists of a series of large gates that can be opened or closed to control the amount of water that flows through them. It has less control over flow. No solid obstruction is put across the river. There is no provision for transport communication across the river. Barrages are built near cities so that the amount of water flowing in the river can be controlled by opening and closing the gates to save the city from flooding.

These gates are supported on piers at both ends. Barrage: When adjustable gates are installed in a weir to keep up the surface the water at a diverse level at various time, is called barrage. Erosive or the scouringforces on the downstream side of the weir produced … The valves are positioned between the pillars that have the task of supporting the water load of the pool created. During the floods, “the gates are raised to clear off the high flood There is some confusion around the difference between weirs and barrages, more particularly how they fit in the spectrum of the dams category as a whole. Both weirs and barrages are obstacles to the watercourse, but the barrage is an expensive structure, while the weir is a relatively cheap structure. The function of a Barrage is similar to that of weir, but the heading up of water is controlled by the gates alone. In this method, the water level is raised up to the needed height and the extra water is permitted to discharge over the weir. Design of Weir and Barrage Data required for the design of a weir or a barrage: High flood levels for the river at the weir site High flood or maximum flood discharge for the river at the weir site River cross section at the weir site. Terms* Normal water pressure on the downstream face of the weir. The heading up of water is affected by gates put across the river. A barrage is considered as a type of dam consisting of a series of large gates that can be closed or opened to have a control on the amount of water passing through it. Weir is a type of dam that is constructed across a river mainly to control the flow of water. A barrage is a weir that has adjustable gates installed over top of it, to allow different water surface heights at different times. A weir is a small dam built across a river to control the upstream water level. When adjustable gates are installed in a weir to keep up the surface the water at a diverse level at various time, is called barrage. It has relatively high control over flow and water level from the operation of gates. Lower Fitzroy Weir The Eden Bann Weir is about 62 km northwest of Rockhampton on the Fitzroy River and was built in 1994 to supply water to Stanwell Power Station. The water is raised up to the required height and the water then flows over the weir. In this article, you will learn the differences between a weir and barrage. What is WEIR ? 3. This allows the structure to adjust and stabilize the elevation of the upstream water for irrigation and other systems. Frisco, Texas - The Sod Poodles used an offensive barrage and solid pitching to win a third straight game at Dr. Pepper Ballpark in Frisco, getting by the Frisco RoughRiders 10-5 on Sunday afternoon. Weir and Barrage In general, the above purpose can be accomplished by constructing a barrier across the river, so as to raise the water level on the upstream side of the obstruction, and thus, to feed the main canals taking off from its upstream side at one or both of its flanks. The water level is adjusted by operating the adjustable gates. Log chutes. The weight of the water supported by the crest and the weight of the weir. Weir and Barrage - MCQ 1. Whereas Barrage is a structure used as to obstruct water course made of steel gates. Weir is an impenetrable boundary that is developed over a river or waterway to raise the water level on the upstream side.
