The Speed Distance Time Calculator can solve for the unknown sdt value given two known values. Calculate Running Pace Based on Distance and Time; Run Distance: KM Miles: Run Time: HH MM SS : Run Pace: Min/Km Min/Mile : Run Speed: KM/hr Miles/hr : Training Pace Calculator; Recent race length (you can use a decimal point, e.g. Runners should re-calculate their Race Times and Optimal Training Paces every 4-8 weeks based on racing and training improvements or whenever a new fitness level is achieved as indicated by faster racing. Speed, Distance & Time Calculator. The McMillan Running Calculator is based on what we know from exercise science and real world running. Calculator Use. 26.2): My time (hours:minutes:seconds): : : Display my â¦ Need to calculate your running / race / pace speed? Running time - how to predict? Male Female Age Under 20 years old 20 years old level 30 years old level 40 years old level 50 years old level 60 years old level or over Occupation Calculate speed, distance or time using the formula d = st, distance equals speed times time.  You may also be interested in our Steps to Miles Calculator or APFT Calculator (Army Physical Fitness Test Calculator) Use this speed calculator to easily calculate the average speed, distance travelled and the trip duration of a vehicle: car, bus, train, bike, motorcycle, plane etc. Running Calculator Our running calculator allows you to enter a race time, and then uses that to determine equivalent times for other races distances, as well as appropriate training paces. Treadmill Calculator Distance: Select Race Marathon Half Marathon 1 Mile 3k 5k 8k 10k 12k 15k 10 Miles 20k 25k 30k or Select Unit Meters Kilometers Miles It also allows you to evaluate your time over several distances (1km, 2km, 5km, 10km, 21km, 42km). Thanks to this application you can calculate your running speed in km / h for an entry distance. Use our running calculator, to calculate your running pace, running speed and for race time prediction. Time Pace (min/km):: +options. The calculator assumes you are equally talented and trained for each distance, so it works best when planning for races of similar distances. Works with miles, feet, kilometers, meters, etc.. Type the distance and time of your race in the fields, to see the results below. It can also be used for training purposes through the multipoint pace calculator, convert between units of pace, and estimate a finish time. The running calculator uses the distance and finish time of your most recent race to approximate your current level of fitness. Running pace calculator. Calculations in our running time predictor are based on the mathematical formula published in 1977 in Runner's World Magazine.The equation was devised by Peter Riegel, American research engineer and marathoner.The expression allows predicting race times for runners and other athletes giving a certain performance at another distance. Male or Female ? Unit Pace/Speed. The conversion is based on equivalent fitness, not equivalent pace. Your running pace will be 360 seconds per kilometer (3600 sec/10 km = 360 sec/km), and your speed will be 10 kilometers per hour (10 km/1 h = 10 km/h). Distance. Minutes per km. Thanks to its history of course, you can view different courses and therefore your progress. Running speed [Mets/h] Duration: minutes; BMR ...
