Some major musical patterns, according to Clifford and Betty, that go with the moods and content of the scene are: Chempada (most common and default that applies to a range of moods, in battles and fights between good and evil, also to conclude a scene); Chempa music (depict tension, dispute, disagreement between lovers or competing ideas); Panchari (for odious, preparatory such as sharpening a sword); Triputa (thought-provoking, scenes involving sages and teachers); Adantha (scenes involving kings or divine beings); Muri Adantha musical style (for comic, light-hearted, or fast-moving scenes involving heroic or anger-driven activity). they both are different from each other. Thus Kathakali literally means 'Story-Play'. Traditionally the name of this dance form was deduced by joining two words, âKathaâ and âKaliâ where âKathaâ in Sanskrit means a traditional tale or story and âKaliâ derived from âKalaâ refers to art and performance. Other imminent âKathakaliâ performers include Kalamandalam Krishna Prasad, Kalamandalam Vasu Pisharody, Kalamandalam Kesavan Namboodiri and Kalanilayam Balakrishnan to name a few. whereas kathakali is dance form of kerla. These Attakatha texts grant considerable flexibility to the actors to improvise. [81][82] Jīngjù, a Chinese art of dance-acting (zuo), like Kathakali presents artists with elaborate masks, costumes and colorfully painted faces. [42] Men who act the roles of women also add a false top knot to their left and decorate it in a style common to the region. It is noted for the attractive make-up of characters, elaborate costumes, detailed gestures and well-defined body movements presented in tune with the anchor playback music and complementary percussion. It is indigenous to southwestern India, particularly the state of Kerala, and is based on subject matter from the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and stories from Shaiva literature. [69] In modern times, professional schools train students of Kathakali, with some such as those in Trivandrum Margi school emphasizing a single teacher for various courses, while others such as the Kerala Kalamandalam school wherein students learn subjects from different teachers. [38] These vary with the styles and the predominant colours made from rice paste and vegetable colors that are applied on the face. All of these three gunas (good, evil, active) are present in everyone and everything, it is the proportion that is different, according to the Hindu worldview. Kathakali (katha, story, kali, performance) is a special type of Indian dance drama. [30] These Attakatha texts grant considerable flexibility to the actors to improvise. [24] Kathakali also expanded the performance repertoire, style and standardized the costume making it easier for the audience to understand the various performances and new plays. âRamanattamâ differed from âKrishnanattamâ of Sri Manavedan Raja as the former was written in local Malayalam language while the latter was in Sanskrit. They typically deal with the Mahabarat, the Ramayana and the ancient scriptures known as the Puranas. [79][80], Kabuki, another Japanese art form, has similarities to Kathakali. Although, there are only six forms of the classical dances recognised by the country on a national level. [69] Kathakali schools are now found all over India, as well as in parts of Western Europe and the United States. These two regions of India are having their own significance and totally different in traditions and culture. This classification of characters according to Zarrilli reflects the three Gunas namely sattva (goodness, virtuous, harmonious, constructive), rajas (passion, egoistic, dynamic, action, aimless), and tamas (darkness, viciousness, chaotic, destructive) of the âGu?aâ theory of personalities that originated in the age-old âSamkhyaâ school of Hindu philosophy. Jones and Ryan state it is more than 500 years old. [57], A tradition Kathakalī play typically consists of two interconnected parts, the third-person Shlokas and first-person Padams. [28] Traditionally, a Kathakali performance is long, starting at dusk and continuing through dawn, with interludes and breaks for the performers and audience.
