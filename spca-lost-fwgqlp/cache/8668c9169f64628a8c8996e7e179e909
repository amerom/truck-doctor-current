Wind shear occurs when winds at different levels of the atmosphere push against the rotating cylinder of winds, weakening the rotation by pushing it apart at different levels. Nine hours later the system was upgraded to a tropical storm and given the name Zeta. These visualizations depict the GPM satellite pass about seven hours after Hurricane Eta made landfall on the coast of Nicaragua as a category 4 storm. TyphooTV APK provides frequent updates so that you donât get bored and enjoy amazing latest features. While broad bands of rain circle the storm, GPM shows that the center itself is ragged and the eye of the storm is asymmetric. Typhoon TV has been recently updated to Version 2.2.9. I will never promote something that I personally don't use or recommend. Widespread damage to high-risk structures; Very heavy damage to medium-risk structures This update give the typhoon H even more sophisticated functionality making it even better to use as an aerial photography drone. MUR incorporates temperature data from multiple NASA, NOAA, and international satellites, as well as ship and buoy observations. Find Vietnam Typhoon Latest News, Videos & Pictures on Vietnam Typhoon and see latest updates, news, information from NDTV.COM. One example is the landslide detection maps from the Semi-Automatic Landslide Detection (SALaD) project, which use machine learning to analyze data from commercial Planet Labs satellites and the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite. NASAâs rainfall data is provided to forecasters at the National Hurricane Center and is reflected in one of the key messages. Near real-time data for tracking the storm is also made available on the portalâsÂ Tropical Cyclone Dashboard. Rainfall throughout most of the storm and in fragmented bands of thunderstorms north and east of the center was estimated as falling at a rate between 5 and 15 mm (0.2 to 0.6 inches) per hour. Download the latest version of Typhoon TV Apk from here. Naval Laboratory in Washington, D.C., the IMERG rainfall data was overlaid on infrared imagery from NOAAâs GOES-16 satellite to provide a full extent of the storm. The latest minimum central pressure estimated from NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft data is 962 millibars. What the IMERG does is “morph” high-quality satellite observations along the direction of the steering winds to deliver information about rain at times and places where such satellite overflights did not occur. Credit: NASA Goddard Scientific Visualization Studio. Norbert is moving toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 kph).Â  A northwestward motion with a gradual decrease in forward speed is expected through tonight. Half-hourly rainfall estimates from NASAâs multi-satellite IMERG dataset are shown in 2D on the ground, while rainfall rates from GPMâs DPR instrument are shown as a 3D point cloud, with liquid precipitation shown in green, yellow and red, and frozen precipitation shown in blue and purple. Maximum sustained winds were near 15 mph (30 kph) with higher gusts. Hurricane Eta (a Category 1) over Nicaragua on 11/4/2020 at approximately 5:25Z. These processes release heat near the center of the circulating storm, helping to consolidate it. ESA Sentinel-2 data was also used to detect likely flooded areas at Hondurasâ San Pedro Sula airport.Â  The Program can take the landslide and flood detection data, then combine it with openly available population data and road maps, and deliver actionable guidance to local decision makers on where to best direct their response efforts.

The NASA / JAXAÂ GPM Core ObservatoryÂ satellite passed over Hurricane Delta Thursday October 8, 2020 at approximately 7:40pm CT (00:40 UTC on 10/9/2020), capturing data on the intensity of precipitation within the storm as it approached the Gulf Coast. At the time Terra passed overhead, Delta had weakened to a tropical depression with maximum sustained winds near 25 mph (35 kph). TROYPOINT Subscribers can always install the latest release of Typhoon TV and other great apps through the Rapid App Installer inside the TROYPOINT Application. (SeeÂ 27 Storms: Arlene to ZetaÂ for a summary of the 2005 hurricane season). By Michael Carlowicz, with scientific interpretation from Timothy Hall of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Many of the available imagery layers are updated within three hours of observation, essentially showing the entire Earth as it looks “right now.”. A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect from west of High Island to Sargent, Texas and east of Morgan City, Louisiana to the mouth of the Pearl River, including New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas. Itâs more fun having the Typhoon app on your Android, IOS, Mi 4K TV Box, or PC device. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationÂ (NOAA) GOES-16 satellite (one of many geostationary NOAA satellites developed and launched by NASA) captured a natural-color image on Nov. 16 at 10 a.m. local time when the storm was at its peak strength.
