He received additional revenues from various bishoprics and from the wealthy monastery of St. Albans. [19], The Treaty of London is often regarded as Wolsey's finest moment, but it was abandoned within a year. Wolsey attempted to make peace with France by promoting a European-wide peace treaty in 1518 and by arranging meetings between Henry and the French king Francis I and between Henry and the emperor Charles V in 1520. Following the success of the English campaign in France and the peace negotiations that followed, Wolsey's ecclesiastical career advanced further: in 1523 he became Bishop of Durham, a post with wide political powers, and thus became known as Prince-Bishop of Durham.

Henry soon appointed to his Privy Council men more sympathetic to his own views and inclinations. In addition England was able to keep the captured city of Tournai and secure an increase in the annual pension France paid.[14].

His motivation has been attributed to his determination to have a son and heir, and to his desire for Anne Boleyn, one of his wife's maids-of-honour. The final blow to this policy came in 1529, when the French made peace with Charles. Henry VIII appointed Wolsey royal almoner upon his accession to the throne in 1509. Though England was not part of it, the League was organised in part by Wolsey with papal support.

Just before his death he reputedly spoke these words: I see the matter against me how it is framed. [2] Widespread traditions identify his father as a butcher; his modest origin became a topic of criticism later, when he amassed wealth and power critics thought more befitting a member of the high nobility.

Less than three months later, he died and was succeeded by the young and ambitious  Francis I. The system in both courts concentrated on simple, inexpensive cases, and promised impartial justice. Henry felt the people would accept only a male sovereign, not his daughter Mary.

Their dislikes and mistrusts partly stemmed from Wolsey's excessive demands for money in the form of the Subsidy or benevolences. Wolsey advised the king not to execute the newlyweds, but to embrace them; whether this was out of care for the couple or because of the threat they posed to his own safety remains unclear. 5 He also attempted, as legate, to force reform on monastic orders like the Augustinian canons. The edict that priests, regardless of their functions or the character of their work, should remain celibate had not been wholeheartedly accepted in England. In 1517, Pope Leo X sought peace in Europe to form a crusade against the Ottoman Empire.

Wolsey conducted national enquires into enclosures in 1517, 1518 and 1527. We begin by thinking about Wolsey’s rise from relatively obscure beginnings, including his early work in the church, his service to Henry’s father (Henry VII) and his appointment as Royal Almoner in 1509.

Under Henry VIII’s recommendation, Wolsey was later made Bishop of Lincoln in 1514, Archbishop of York in 1514, Cardinal in 1515, and Lord Chancellor of England in 1515. On Henry’s recommendation Pope Leo X made him bishop of Lincoln (February 1514), archbishop of York (September 1514), and cardinal (1515).

Though it seemed to open the door to peaceful negotiations with France if the king wished, it was also a chance for a lavish display of English wealth and power before the rest of Europe, through flamboyant celebrations and events such as jousting, with the two kings personally competing against each other. Wolsey's affairs prospered, and by 1514 he was the controlling figure in virtually all matters … When his final attempt to obtain the annulment collapsed in July 1529, these enemies easily turned the king against him. Meanwhile, the French also continued to honour the "Auld Alliance" with Scotland, stirring up hostility on England's border. In the course of his administration he used the court of Chancery to prosecute 264 landowners, including peers, bishops, knights, religious heads, and Oxford colleges. From 1515, when he became cardinal, until his death, Wolsey used art and architecture to underpin his positions. Meanwhile, a turnover of rulers in Europe threatened to diminish England's influence.

The immediate cause of Wolsey’s fall from power was his failure to persuade Pope Clement VII to grant Henry an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. In so doing, he brought Italian Renaissance ideas, classical embellishments, and architectural models into English architecture. Wolsey benefitted from Henry VII's introduction of measures to curb the power of the nobility; the king was willing to favour those from more humble backgrounds. Wolsey's failure to secure the annulment directly caused his downfall and arrest. [29] Wolsey subsequently had two children, both before he was made bishop: a son, Thomas Wynter (born circa 1510),[30] and a daughter, Dorothy (born circa 1512),[31] both of whom lived to adulthood. In 1498 he was ordained a priest, and five years later he became chaplain to Sir Richard Nanfan, deputy lieutenant of Calais, who recommended him to King Henry VII (reigned 1485–1509). [27] These lands had passed onto his heir, Henry VIII. 4 When did Pope Leo X appoint Wolsey as a Cardinal? [32] Following his rapid promotion, Larke became a source of embarrassment to Wolsey, who arranged for her marriage to George Legh of Adlington, in Cheshire, circa 1519.

Enclosures were seen as directly linked to rural unemployment and depopulation, vagrancy, food shortages and, accordingly, inflation. Historians agree that Wolsey was a man dogged by other men's failures and his own ambition. Until 1511, Wolsey was adamantly antiwar, but when the king expressed his enthusiasm for an invasion of France, Wolsey adapted his views to the king's and gave persuasive speeches to the Privy Council in favour of war. This is well illustrated by the Anglo-French treaty signed two days afterwards. The result of this venture was further resentment by the nobility and the gentry. Was willing to take on the mundane tasks of government . Wolsey was confident of the decision, but Campeggio took a long time to arrive, and when he finally did, he delayed proceedings so much that the case had to be suspended in July 1529, effectively sealing Wolsey's fate. After failing to negotiate an annulment of Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, Wolsey fell out of favour and was stripped of his government titles. What was lacking, Mattingly concludes, was a neutral power whose judgements were generally accepted either by impartial justice or by overwhelming force.

King Henry VIII made Wolsey his almoner immediately on his accession, and the receipt of some half-dozen further ecclesiastical preferments in the first two years of the reign marks his growth in royal favor. In 1529 Wolsey was stripped of his government office and property, including his magnificently expanded residence of Hampton Court, which Henry took to replace the Palace of Westminster as his own main London residence. He provided the dowry. Sara Nair James, a professor at Mary Baldwin College, says that in 1515–1529 Wolsey "would be the most powerful man in England except, possibly, for the king". The current… This greatly eased disorder and became common practice after a disappointing harvest. He initiated a building campaign on a scale not only unprecedented for an English churchman and Lord Chancellor, but also exceeded by few English kings.

Wolsey chose Charles mainly because England's economy would suffer from the loss of the lucrative cloth trade industry between England and the Netherlands had France been chosen instead. Despite making promises to reform the bishoprics of England and Ireland, and, in 1519, encouraging monasteries to embark on a programme of reform, he did nothing to bring about these changes. In the case of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, Wolsey adopted a different strategy, attempting to win Suffolk's favour by his actions after the duke secretly married Henry's sister Mary Tudor, Dowager Queen of France, much to the king's displeasure. 1515: Archbishop of York and Lord Chancellor of England.

He had invested enormous sums in bribing the electorate to elect him emperor, and thus used the Treaty of London as a justification for the Habsburg-Valois conflict. Henry often receives credit for artistic patronage that properly belongs to Wolsey.[28]. Catherine, however, maintained that she had been a virgin when she married Henry. England formed an alliance with Julius, King Ferdinand V of Spain, and Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor against King Louis XII of France. First, he tried to convince the Pope that the dispensation was void as the marriage clearly disobeyed instructions in the book of Leviticus.
