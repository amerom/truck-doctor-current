It has been shown that SALL4 is only weakly positive in three out of 45 clear cell carcinomas in ovaries. The tumors … The distinction between malignant mixed müllerian tumor (MMMT) of the female genital tract and poorly differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma (EA) is sometimes difficult and arbitrary. SALL4 nuclear immunoreactivity was detected in 6 out of 19 cases (33%).

Issues in the Differential Diagnosis of Uterine Low-grade Endometrioid Carcinoma, Including Mixed Endometrial Carcinomas: Recommendations from the International Society of Gynecological Pathologists. 2015 Jun 10;6(16):14646-55. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.3711. Uterine malignant mixed müllerian tumors (MMMTs) are rare and highly aggressive malignancies with poor clinical prognoses. Review articles are excluded from this waiver policy. The staining extent ranged from focal to extensive. Carcinosarcomas (malignant mixed Müllerian tumors or MMMT) are rare malignant tumors in the female genital tract composed of both malignant epithelial and malignant mesenchymal components. In this study, we showed that there was high percentage of positivity of GPC3 in both mesenchymal and epithelial components of MMMTs, indicating the stain for this marker has a limited role in the differential diagnosis between MMMT and YST. Glypican-3 is a membrane-bound heparin sulfate proteoglycan. Sections were incubated with respective primary antibody for 15 minutes at room temperature followed by detection of the antigen with a biotin-free polymeric horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linker antibody conjugate system (Refine Polymer, Leica Microsystems) for 8 minutes at room temperature. SALL4 is a zinc finger transcription factor and a homologue of drosophila spalt gene, which plays an important role in the specification of head and tail regions in the embryonic development [11]. In this study, immunohistochemical stains of germ cell markers, including SALL4, OCT3/4, glypican-3, and alpha-fetal protein (AFP), and CDX2 were performed in a series of MMMTs. 2017 Sep;36(5):412-419. doi: 10.1097/PGP.0000000000000346. 23 cases of uterine MMMT identified from the Saskatchewan Cancer Agency (1970-1999) were evaluated. The coexpression of K and V in the epithelial component of 35% of cases and in the stromal component of 48% of cases led the authors to conclude that the immunoprofile of MMMT broadly overlaps with that of EA and, independent of morphologic findings, it is often not reliable or useful in distinguishing between the two. Malignant mixed mullerian tumor of fallopian tube with multiple distinct heterologous components. … MMMT is characterized by the presence of both carcinomatous and sarcomatous components with a poor prognosis [1]. We examined for differences in the oncoprotein profiles of primary versus recurrent MMMTs. 			USA.gov. The aim of our study was to evaluate survival outcomes in malignant mixed Mullerian tumors (MMMT) of the uterus with respect to the role of cell cycle and apoptotic regulatory proteins in the carcinomatous and sarcomatous components. Please enable it to take advantage of the complete set of features! Abstract. SALL4 appears to involve the proliferation and the self-renewal of cancer cells [10, 14]. 			NIH The extent of stain ranged from focal to diffuse, and the intensity of the stains was moderate to strong (Figure 1(b)). Optimal cytoreduction seems to be the only therapy to have some impact on survival. A uterine MMMT can be either homologous or heterologous. Uterine Malignant Mixed Mullerian Tumor (MMMT) is an uncommon neoplasm with aggressive clinical course. 1991 Jun;115(6):583-90. Although several studies have described the immunohistochemical … 			HHS The mesenchymal component could show focal weak-to-moderate positivity.

National Center for Biotechnology Information, Unable to load your collection due to an error, Unable to load your delegates due to an error. Despite the fact that CDX2 reactivity could be detected in small number of other non-GI tract epithelial tumors, it has been used as a diagnostic marker for tumor of GI tract origin in surgical pathology practice. In this study, we showed low rate of positivity of this marker in MMMTs. One case was diffusely and the other case was focally positive. Sebenik M, Yan Z, Khalbuss WE, Mittal K. Malignant mixed mullerian tumor of the vagina: case report with review of the literature, immunohistochemical … Role of TGF-β signaling in uterine carcinosarcoma. Two cases were focally positive, and the intensity of the stain was moderate (score 1.5). The staining intensity was usually intermediate to strong (the score ranged from 1.5 to 3, and average score was 2.3 ± 0.5 in the positive cases). The final scores were achieved by the sum of intensity (0, negative; 1, weak intensity; 2, moderate intensity; 3, strong intensity) and extent of the immunoreactivity (0, negative; 1, <30%; 2, 30–70%; 3, >70%) divided by 2. Dwivedi SK, McMeekin SD, Slaughter K, Bhattacharya R. Oncotarget. The diagnosis of MMMT is usually not difficult; occasionally differentiation from various biphasic tumors such as mixed germ cell tumor can be difficult if the tumor occurred in relative younger age. In addition, it was found that the positive tumor cells were distributed in clusters instead of a more diffuse pattern [22]. Generally considered metaplastic carcinomas (putatively arise from epithelial cells only); they are not true sarcomas. The sarcomatous component can be homologous or heterologous depending on whether it is composed of native mesenchymal elements of the organ it arises from or other nonnative elements such as rhabdmyoblastic, osteogenic, chondroblastic, or lipoblastic element. Nineteen cases of MMMTs were retrieved from the database of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, in which thirteen cases were from uterus, four from ovary, and two metastatic. Evidence for a common etiology for endometrial carcinomas and malignant mixed mullerian tumors. The results from one cytogenetic study of 43 MMMT cases favored monoclonal theory. The mechanism of SALL4 in the pathogenesis and its role in the prognosis of this tumor need further investigation.
