The bowed-out shape of the production possibilities curve results from allocating resources based on comparative advantage. efficiency. Sort by: Top Voted. Production Possibilities 1.3 Trade offs and opportunity costs can be illustrated using a Production Possibilities Curve. Fixed resources 2. Increasing opportunity cost. A. Scarcity – Limitations – insufficient resources, goods, or abilities to achieve the desired ends. B. Attainable combinations of both goods below the curve. A production possibility frontier is used to illustrate the concepts of opportunity cost, trade-offs and also show the effects of economic growth. The Production Possibilities Curve (PPC) is a model that captures scarcity and the opportunity costs of choices when faced with the possibility of producing two goods or services. Efficiency. At this point in time, Maverick has A. A production possibilities curve shows the combinations of two goods an economy is capable of producing. Perhaps the most fundamental concept to economics, opportunity cost is what must be given up in order to undertake any activity or economic exchange. The downward slope of the production possibilities curve is an implication of scarcity. Practice: Interpreting graphs of the production possibilities curve (PPC) Practice: Calculating opportunity costs from a production possibilities curve (PPC) Next lesson. Suppose the country of Maverick has specialized in the production of a good but has not yet entered into trade. Explain how the four economic ideas below are illustrated by the production possibilities curve. Figure 2, below, illustrates these ideas using a production possibilities frontier between hea lth care and education. Which of the following scenarios are illustrated in this particular PPC? Opportunity Costs – The loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen. Explain how production possibilities curves show efficiency, growth, and cost. Production Possibilities. A. asked by trista on January 12, 2009; econ. Given 2 assumptions: 1. We cannot increase the output of one good without decreasing the output of another. Points within the curve show when a country’s resources are not being fully utilised  PPC—shows all the possible combinations of 2 goods or services. Points on the interior of the PPC are inefficient, points on the PPC are … a line on a production possibilities curve that shows the maximum possible output an economy can produce. Maximum efficiency. The production possibilities frontier can illustrate two kinds of efficiency: productive efficiency and allocative efficiency. Comparative advantage and the terms of trade . Production at C bering better than production at B. B. 3. Date: Facilitator: School: 1.04 PPF Basics 1. Every choice about the use of a resource comes with an opportunity cost, and these choices can be illustrated in a simple model called the Production Possibilities Curve (PPC). using resources in such a way as to maximize the production of goods and services.
