You will have to rely on Free Aim if you want to pick them off from a distance. . . ) Equip your Assault Rifle class gun now. Do NOT post them here or advertise them, as per the forum rules. There is a sniper position up on the roof, a dumpster underneath the log flume that offers total protection from enemy vehicles and helicopters, and an actual indoor position that would be even better if enemies poured in there. Like with most two-player spots, you really need to rely on your buddy to watch your back while you watch theirs. There's almost nothing to do until enemy vehicles start to show up. Topic....From Paleto Bay, I've only been able to deliver 3 of the 4 packages when selling coke/weed etc solo....The bikes the game gives you are just not fast enough. At least if one of those hit the roof it will not kill you instantly. Just like the West Entrance, but not as much activity on this side, usually. Pull out your favorite pistol and shoot enemies as they come from the south. As usual these Waves shouldn't be too tough, but use your Snacks and Body Armor when necessary. You will have better protection from helicopter gunfire, but enemies will be harder to target. You might not think it, to look at it, but you can actually shoot THROUGH the wall, from up here, and get a bead on enemies coming from the north. More than that, and you may be at a disadvantage. Enemies take cover around the other end of the nearby green container. If you didn’t know already you can hold down the Back/Select button and bring up the User Interface (UI). Enemy vehicles will start to show up but the only worry you have are the occupants who will come up the stairs on the left. Also, take out the guys on the roller coaster platform first too. In fact in Wave 9 go right ahead and toss about ten of them around the main open area, and concentrate on enemies that will flank around behind (at least until the gas clears). Nothing fancy as far as tactics, just kill enemies and then save the helicopter for last. Enemies that come from that direction will also take cover behind the palm tree. Typically, helicopters feature a main body, cockpit, engine bay, tail boom and a number of blades on the main rotor. You can hit them with shotgun fire from your current position, but make sure you make the guys in the foreground your main priority. You are partially protected by helicopter fire but you might have trouble aiming at the right side occasionally. This is a very useful tactic in any combat scenario, and especially in solo Survival. Toss a couple Grenades over the wall before getting close to it. Those vehicles can really pick your Armor and Health bars apart. With just you, it's one helicopter again. While focusing on them you should also keep an eye on the approaching enemies, switching to your SMG when they get close enough. Red arrows represent enemy approaches, blue arrow is the location of your position, green dots are Body Armor locations. You develop a strategy in your head about how you're going to help your team succeed, and at the same time how you'll live to see the conclusion and get that $30,000. Vehicles will come from the left and right at the nearby street. There are other decent areas to hide if you're playing this with other people. The entrance to the same courtyard that has the dumpster. This should be the last Wave where you’ll do any initial shooting from the outside balcony. I probably should have mentioned this earlier but solo Survival may take about a half-hour or more. However, this spot works great when playing with other players. Between this Wave and the next, as you’re going to get Body Armor, set up a Proximity Mine on the right stairs leading to the street. You can also get a bead on enemy vehicles as they come down the road behind you to the north-west. The red dots will eventually make their way onto the stairs allowing you to shoot them. Press question mark to learn the rest of the keyboard shortcuts There are places to hide, but not all of them are great when you're playing on your own. *I’m not liable for ammo lost when killed by some guy in Free Roam. This was my original favorite! Once it does; get out of cover and go to the wall by the street. Regardless, if you can't get in your favorite spot there are some others you can hold up in. Each of you can cover either end of the train car. Probably the best spot in co-op. Use Tear Gas Grenades to thin the herds, it’s the last Wave so no reason to save them for anything. Enemy vehicles will start to appear. When a vehicle shows up, turn your attention to it, and pick off as many enemies as you can. Of only two Armor spawn locations, one of them is up a ladder. You have a small field of view and enemies can take cover near the other containers. The Post-Op vans are just too painfully slow to have any shot at completing anything worthwhile in time, but everything else is not a problem even at full product capacity. Because of the helicopter flight patterns, this will help you manage a fair one-on-one fight with each aircraft. Both players pick a direction and cover each other. In most Survival maps, two players seem to be the magic number. This is a mostly indoor map where you must defend yourself on the O’Neil Farm, the location of the single player mission “Crystal Maze.” For this strategy you’re going to be defending the second floor; from the top of the stairs and around the outside balconies. Even if you play Co-op mode, the tips and foolproof strategy included will guarantee your team's success (but no promises past Wave 10 if you're playing Endless Waves)! Equip an LMG. You should bring a Heavy Shotgun with plenty of ammo, full Tear Gas Grenades, and make sure you have an inventory full of consumables. The blue X is your Solo spot for Waves 1-6. It's also an unusually good spot for fighting helicopters although you're not completely invincible. When you can find the time for it, and while you’re in cover mode, stand still for a few seconds when your health is in the red. If you accidentally go above 2 bars and can't find a friend or prospect to help you out - consider destroying the surplus trucks before heading out. The wrong tools can make a simple task into an ordeal. The vehicles can be purchased on Warstock Cache & Carry immediately, or alternatively for a discounted price after meeting the requirements (if any).Two of the vehicles are modifiable variants of pre-existing armed vehicles - the Technical and the Insurgent Pick-Up, vehicles which can be driven throug… But unlike CEO crates there's no fiscal incentive to wait and sell large quantities. Equip your LMG and don’t be stingy with the Tear Gas, Grenade Launcher, and Snacks from this point forward. (Provided the ensuing gunfire doesn't break the machine.). Do not engage the helicopter until all of the ground forces have been dispatched. Enemies will now have Combat MG’s and Miniguns. Equip your pistol and start at the east end of the container. Use that Sticky Bomb you set up earlier when you feel the time is right. Here's when the Cayo Perico Heist is expected to come out. You can also toss a Tear Gas Grenade to your left if you are being overwhelmed to your right and straight-ahead. And the red UFO/dotted t-shirt is where Enemy Vehicles come from. Use Tear Gas for these guys, you can kill two or three at a time this way. Take this time to gather supplies because their “last stand” won’t last long. Pull out your handgun and start shooting when they get within targeting range. Basically bro. At the end of each Wave grab the Body Armor at the bottom of the entry stairs on the left. Not really a necessity but very welcome in this Wave because of the two helicopters. On the plus side, there is a Body Armor spawn close by, as well as a First Aid Kit around the corner. You get decent cover from helicopters and enemies can only come at you from two different directions making it ideal for co-op play. This time toss two Gas Grenades to the bottom of the stairs. This provides both good cover from enemies and helicopters. That's usually the case with these Waves, and it goes double for "Legion Square." Once a red dot enters that welcome them with buckshot. Once the helicopters are down, go back to dealing with ground threats. Just take cover, and when you pop up to aim, your character will aim through the wall. Good tips, thanks guys. You might not always have time to, and you might catch a bullet or two once enemies bunch up, but it will save you some precious Snacks. Here they are by Wave (for the original nine Survivals). If enemies get in close they will chip your Armor and Health away very easily. The idea is to block the alley to prevent enemies from flanking you. The last time I'm going to suggest the alcove below the roof. Remember, if you're not comfortable with staying on the roof there is always the alcove below. Here you have maximum protection against gunfire and somewhat good protection from helicopters. This is the closest Body Armor spawn point to the Hotdog Stand. Make sure to blow up the fence before you begin, enemies can take cover down there. Some will come from the west, and it's a good idea to take them out first since they can hit you easier. Either way, pepper it with bullets until "(insert Gamertag) has destroyed a helicopter." This is the same as the Solo spot but without moving dumpsters. Supply runs in heavily populated lobbies aren't worth it though. For the most part, you won’t always find the helicopters of the story in the online world. Enemies that disembark from vehicles will also go into the front yard down to your right. This won’t make them impossible to kill but it’s something to look out for. Just be careful of the sneaky ones who will climb up the hill to your right, and the others that try to flank you from the left. Be quick to shoot it down. You can also save the helicopter for last. Keep using your SMG and shoot enemies until you see the helicopter icon appear on the radar. Whichever way you face you can gun down enemies and still have good cover from those your attention is not on. Then retreat to the back of the roof and spray it with your Minigun. At the east end of the area, inside the actual airplane graveyard, is the carcass of a jet airliner. The majority of enemies will come from the south-east and funnel in the middle area near the entrance to the plant. I would also recommend taking out all of the ground enemies before exposing yourself to gunfire. If you think you can fire off a Grenade as they pass by, do so, but make sure your line of fire is clear. I can tell you that it’s used more for displacing enemies than killing them (much like in real life). Enemies will disembark from them, but should not be a problem for you since they will mostly appear from the south in this Wave. The Micro-SMG, pistols, and the Double Barrel Shotgun don’t seem to have this problem. Naturally, these GTA: Online deals will only be available for a limited time – specifically, from November 27 through November 30. Keep an eye on guys that will come down through the log piles to your left, as well as more enemies from vehicles to the east. I have 3 businesses, Coke, Meth, Counterfeit. The Sticky Bombs set-up from Waves 5 and 6 will help make short work of the rest once the helicopter has been shot down. The only challenge here is trusting your partner. Make use of Snacks and watch out for enemies that will take cover down below to your right. Equip your SMG. Just in case you are on the right side of the container a simple push of the right on the D-pad can fix all of your problems later on. You can pick off enemies from across the road, and when they get in close you can easily shotgun them. However if you venture too far from this spot the dumpsters will reset. Powered by Invision Community. Enemies will mainly come from the north but some will come from your right. Maybe they’re scared it will get shaken up in their pocket? More vehicles will come in these waves. I assume the trips from a Sandy Shore/Grape seed businesses are all shorter, relatively? I switch between coke, weed and counterfeit money. It's good to have three businesses, get three bars of supplies for each, and sell at a bar-and-a-half each. If you were playing Co-op, the game would throw three helicopters at you now. You know if you're the impatient type. You have just enough time to grab it, and get back up to your spot, before the shooting starts. Remember to re-heal and put on a new set of Armor whenever necessary. It's impossible to do more than two PO van deliveries on your own. This Wave will take the longest, probably because the stakes are so high. If it's the Post Ops vans or Dodo delivery, good luck. Use a shotgun (preferably Assault or Heavy) for enemies that come to the entrance of the alley. For Wave 2 throw a Tear Gas Grenade at the bottom of the stairs. You have opportunities for sniping and enemy vehicle demolition from here. Once the helicopter is out of the equation, switch to your SMG, and take out the remaining ground forces. Some helicopters won’t spawn unless you’re in … Guaranteed someone will blow up the other trucks or helicopters while i'm making the deliveries so now I sell when it hits $30,000 so I only have to make one trip & It doesn't seem to affect overall profits at all. Use an assault rifle to fight off the first batch of gunmen. Don't get cocky and try to go Rambo on all the NPCs... you will be brought down in a matter of seconds. Set off your Sticky Bombs then toss Grenades to help thin them out. At least for the first six Waves. You can shoot at enemies from a 360-degree angle, and you can also get a good bead on enemy vehicles that appear at the entrance. . For Wave 7 there will be a helicopter, save it for last. Also, enemies will take cover inside the bus wreckage in the middle of the yard. If you stay in the middle helicopters have a harder time hitting you. Enemies will start to spawn in vehicles. In the center of the area is an indoor section where you can take cover over by the sawdust. Get more MC members, these missions are meant to be played with others, not by yourself. Very comprehensive guide. If you’re lucky, you can grab one during a wave depending on where you’re roosted. Equip an SMG. You know because Miniguns and LMGs are like that . A Grenade or two couldn't hurt. Those missions aren't too difficult. You are also close to a Body Armor spawn. I'm not going to waste my time with them because I'm honestly a little disappointed that we're not fighting waves of aliens. On a sell run in a heavily populated lobby (but the population is all killing each other in Rockford) I make over a hundred grand (coke, the weed isn't that profitable. Aim for the pilot, if you have a Minigun aim for the engine. Enemies will start to pour in heavier now. Once you’ve created some breathing room use your Minigun on the helicopter and an assault rifle for the leftover gunmen. I bought a helipad in single player and then bought a helicopter. When you spend THAT much time with a game, you can't help but write about it. You can use a Shotgun, if you prefer, due to the close proximity of enemy approaches. That doesn’t mean stop being careful. If you insist on playing it with four people the following spots are pretty good. Within this doorway, you have some cover from helicopters and you can also shift positions against the gunfire, in later Waves, when things get thick. Also when you leave cover, make sure to shoot at it from the low end of the roof to prevent getting shot from ground enemies. (Note: To get the ball rolling, with the Minigun, you will have to use some kind of explosives to "shake them loose.") In GTA V, the Swift is the fastest helicopter available in the game, although it is clumsier and harder to maneuver compared to other helicopters such as the Frogger or Buzzard. Use your Grenade Launcher on any others. Make a "crawler" and set up a Sticky Bomb at this spot whenever you can. Sometimes, enemies can come around the other end of the container to attack (one of their spawn points is on the other side of the fence behind you). . So will enemy vehicles carrying up to four foes each. The spots I list below are great for solo play, but when playing Co-op, the enemy spawn points will spread out further. . . I never thought of trying survival alone but you offer some great tips and advice that make it possible. Even when you’re in very good cover, enemies will eventually find a way to get a shot at you. I've only ever got the 3(15) Dodo deliveries, even at full stock, which I was able to make. From the container, you will only be able to snipe the ones that come from the north. Shoot down one, then go through the other exit to shoot down the other. Yourself and a buddy can take cover at either end of this opening and shoot enemies from either side. The garbage container at the south end of the area is where you will hold off enemies for Waves 1-3, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Which is only worth $15k (considering it costs $75k to completely refill if you buy supplies). Use Snacks when you need them and Grenades when the enemies get thick. Same downsides as the other dumpster; enemies can take cover behind the nearby dividers and others will go for the high ground in order to shoot you. For the sake of my sanity, I'm going to stick to the classic ten Waves for these new Survivals. I’ll just say that now and get it out of the way. They are just attacking in trucks so they are not a huge threat for right now. Each player take a side, and during helicopter Waves, one of you volunteer to handle helicopters. You are also protected from helicopter gunfire somewhat. . The idea here is to block the alleyway with the Dumpsters creating a wall. For the record I wrote a walkthrough for three of the Survivals before discovering this, would have been nice to know then .
