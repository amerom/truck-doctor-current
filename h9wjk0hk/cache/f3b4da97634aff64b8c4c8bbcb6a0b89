Lecture #28: Plate Tectonics . And this Chile Ridge is subducted beneath the South American Plate at 46 degree south latitude. The eastern edge of the plate is in a subduction zone beneath the South American plate, and this crash has given rise to the Andes Mountains. Each type of plate boundary generates distinct geologic processes and landforms. Tags: Question 7 . Along its border with the South American Plate is a convergent boundary... See full answer below. Right panel was constructed in GeoMapApp and shows existing multibeam bathymetry data at the western end of the Cocos-Nazca spreading center. 10.4 Plate, Plate Motions, and Plate Boundary Processes. The Nazca plate is moving east, and the South American plate is moving west. Figure 10.4. B.P., just prior to the fragmentation. The North American plate moves westward relative to the Caribbean plate.

(Select all that apply.) This could be related to the ridge jumps between 14.5 to 7.5 Ma and the northward migration of the Cocos-Nazca spreading centre (CNSC) away from the Galapagos Hot Spot (GHS) [Hey et al., 1977; Hey 1977; Barckhausen et al., 2001].and the lithologic continuity can be inclusive to extend as far as a part of the basement Click to see full answer. 30 seconds . Two seamount ridges within the Nazca Plate enter the subduction zone along this trench: the Nazca Ridge and the Juan Fernández Ridge. Location of study area in the equatorial Pacific (white box). The Cocos Plate was created approximately 23 million years ago when the Farallon Plate  broke into two pieces, which also created the Nazca Plate. in what direction is the Nazca plate moving? east. Pacific Plate and the Nazca Plate. Read more... Larger-scale view of the region surrounding the Galapagos Microplate (boxed), which is bound by the Pacific, Nazca, and Cocos Plates (Searle and Francheteau, 1985). complex. These borders are regions of intense seismic activity, including frequent earthquakes, occasional tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions. answer choices . The western boundary is another mid-ocean ridge, the East Pacific Rise. Discovering Plate Boundaries Dale S. Sawyer Rice University yourselves to about 4-5 boundary types. To investigate the mechanism underlying the break-up of the Farallon plate into the Cocos plate and Nazca plate, we analyze the state of stress in the Farallon plate at about 30 m.y. 2. 1 A map showing 15 of the Earth’s tectonic plates and the approximate rates and directions of plate motions. Q. SURVEY . The Nazca Plate, which underlies most of the southeastern Pacific, is being subducted beneath most of the west coast of South America at a rapid rate of 80 to 100 millimetres per year. Nazca Plate. The Nazca Plate, named after the Nazca region of southern Peru, is an oceanic tectonic plate in the eastern Pacific Ocean basin off the west coast of South America. What type of boundary is between the Caribbean and Cocos plates. Notably, there are two “flat-slab” subduction zones between 2°-15°S and 28°-33°30’S that and are distinguished by the lack of late Miocene to Holocene volcanic activity (Gregory-Wodzicki, 2000) (Figure 3). Rates of motions of the major plates range from less than 1 cm/y to over 10 cm/y. Because the Nazca plate carries dense oceanic crust and the South American plate carries less dense continental crust, the Nazca plate will sink beneath the South American plate. A belt of volcanoes extends from northern Panama to western Mexico, and virtually all of the highest mountains in this belt are volcanic. Towards the north the Nazca plate is diverging from the Cocos plate at a rate of 62-42 mm/yr. The northern boundary of the Cocos Plate is the Middle America Trench. The scarp of the narrow ridge marks the boundary between the lithosphere formed at the East Pacific Rise and the Cocos- Nazca spreading center. Nazca Plate. Most of its borders are convergent boundaries including a subduction zone to the west. Transcribed image text: PART 1: IDENTIFY PLATE BOUNDARY FEATURES AND TYPES 1. Roughly 3.2 million square kilometers (1.2 million square miles) in area, the Caribbean Plate borders the North American Plate, the South American Plate, the Nazca Plate and the Cocos Plate. Three types of boundaries exist and a fourth i.e. The eastern boundary is a transform fault, the Panama Fracture Zone. Learn vocabulary, terms, and more with flashcards, games, and other study tools. 4. the overriding plate. In the remaining case, where the Cocos–Nazca plate boundary intersects the Mid-dle American trench, the anomalous magmatic and tectonic features have not been placed in a slab window context. Cocos plate subduction under the Caribbean plate began at the end of the Tertiary, provoking a generalized orogeny accompanied by strong volcanism. View this answer. from the Farallon plate at about 25 Ma [Wortel and Cloetingh, 1981; Lonsdale, 2005]. Explain your answer. Plate borders the North American Plate, the South American Plate, the Nazca Plate and the Cocos Plate. -The pacific plate Examine the interactive globe. convergent.  Based On The Type Of Plate Boundaries That Seperate The Pacific, Nazca, And Cocos Plates, What Type Of Geologic Feature Is Formed At These Boundaries? Use the table below and the Map Key on the “Types of Plate Boundaries Map” to draw the correct symbols identifying each type of plate boundary. According to the plate tectonics theory, the 36. Task 3 . South American Plate and the Nazca Plate. Oceanic plates, such as the Cocos plate, are made up of a type of stone called This plate is bound by the North-American and Caribbean Plates to the north-east, the small Rivera Plate to the north-west, the Pacific Plate to the west, and the Nazca Plate … Boundary types Caribbean Plate. Using the General Plate Boundary Map (figure 1), draw arrows representing the direction of relative plate movement on both sides of the boundaries at the following locations: North American/Pacific (south of Alaska and along U.S. west coast near California) a. b. Pacific/Nazca C. Nazca/South American d. Types of Plate Boundaries Map Identification Directions B 1. At which type(s) of plate boundaries are you likely to have volcanoes? Color your first plate boundary map to locate your group's boundary types. The islands are thought to be a continuous volcanic arc chain of calc-alkaline composition (Nelson et al, 2011). The Cocos Plate also broke into two pieces, creating the small Rivera Plate. What type of plate boundary is in Chile? A) Transform B) Ocean-Ocean Divergent ... in what direction is the cocos plate moving? Start studying Plate tectonics. Along Lightly shade in each tectonic/lithospheric plate with a different color if possible. Pacific Plate and the South American Plate. The Cocos Plate is bounded by several different plates. The northern boundary of the Cocos Plate is the Middle America Trench. What is the mole ratio of O2 to H2O in this reaction4NH3 + 5O2 → 4NO + 6H2O? Part of this volcanic range is a horst due to extreme block-faulting. 10.04: Plate Plate Motions and Plate Boundary Processes#fig10.4.1. The southern boundary is a mid-oceanic ridge, the Galapagos Rise. mixed type is characterized. The Nazca Plate … Here three tectonic  plates meet: the Nazca Plate, the South American Plate, and the Antarctic Plate. Panama's tectonic microplate is a product of the confrontation of the South American tectonic plate with the Caribbean plate and the Nazca and Cocos plates in the Pacific. This movement occurred along which type of plate boundary? Assign a colored pencil color to each boundary type in your classification scheme. In four of the five cases, these anomalies have been explained with models of slab window development. Which features are commonly formed at the plate Peru-Chile Trench and the Andes Mountains formed along the west coast of South America because the South American Plate A) collided with the Nazca Plate divergent. Convergent Boundaries or destructive- Subduction The Cocos Plate is a relatively small sized, triangular-shaped oceanic plate located just west of Mexico and the Caribbean. Each type of interaction causes a characteristic set of earth structures or "Tectonic" features. C) Pacific and Nazca B) Cocos and Caribbean D) Nazca and South American 33. What type of boundary separates the South American Plate from the Nazca Plate? The trench is a result of a convergent boundary, where the eastern edge of the oceanic Nazca Plate is being subducted beneath the continental South American Plate. The Nazca Plate experiences all three types of tectonic plate boundaries. The Andean mountain-chain are actually not directly ON the the join-line of the Nazca and South American tectonic plates. By the end of 1967 the Earth’s surface had been mapped into a series of plates (Figure 10.4.1). Continental drift and sea-floor spreading became widely accepted around 1965 as more and more geologists started thinking in these terms. This boundary of the ocean plate corresponds to a small landslide in the lower slope and is also imaged on track line 7a as a step in the plate boundary beneath the slope (see Figure 6b). The current continental and oceanic plates include: the Eurasian plate, Australian-Indian plate, Philippine plate, Pacific plate, Juan de Fuca plate, Nazca plate, Cocos plate, North American plate, Caribbean plate, South American plate, African plate, Arabian plate, the Antarctic plate, and the Scotia plate. Arrows along the boundary between the South American Plate and the Nazca Plate point toward each other, indicating that the boundary between these two plates is a convergent boundary. These borders are regions of intense seismic activity, including frequent earthquakes, occasional tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions. Vent s and fractures (also called fissure s) in these mid-ocean ridges allow magma and gases to escape into the ocean. A distinct sur-ficial manifestation from the Cocos plate subduc-tion is the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB, Figure 1), which consists of Neogene age arc vol-canoes built on the southern edge of the North American plate [Ferrari et al., 1999, 2011]. The eastern boundary is a transform fault, the Panama Fracture Zone. To this purpose we use finite element methods and a reconstruction of regional plate boundaries appropriate for 30 m.y. The southern boundary is a mid-oceanic ridge, the Galapagos Rise. Tags: Question 16 . The location where two plates meet is called a plate boundary. Plate boundaries are commonly associated with geological events such as earthquakes and the creation of topographic features such as mountains, volcanoes, mid-ocean ridges, and oceanic trenches. transform. Geology. The western boundary is another mid-ocean ridge, the East Pacific Rise. Plate Boundaries: Plate boundaries are the area between the plates where most tectonic activities take place. B.P. Another divergent plate boundary is the East Pacific Rise, which separates the massive Pacific plate from the Nazca, Cocos, and North American plates. At this point, do not try to explain the data; just observe! Because of the motion of the plates they can collide, pull apart, or scrap against each other. C. What two locations are moving together as a result of plate tectonics? This creates a convergent plate boundary. To the northeast it is bounded by the North American Plate  and the Caribbean Pl… Plate Tectonics - is the paradigm that the Earth's lithosphere is divided into a dozen major plates which slide over the asthenosphere in various directions. Cocos Plate and the North American Plate. The Nazca-Antarctic Plate boundary is comprised of the Chile Ridge where new ocean crust is formed. The southern border of the Nazca plate is divergent from the Antarctic plate; the western border is also divergent with the plate of the Pacific, and the north with the plate of Cocos. The Cocos-Nazca spreading center offers an opportunity to examine these and related questions. A triple junction, the Chile Triple Junction,  occurs on the seafloor of the Pacific Ocean  off Taitao  and Tres Montes Peninsula  at the southern coast of Chile. Subduction zones are marked by deep trenches and overlying chains of volcanoes (the Andes, for example). A major subduction zone is located where the Nazca and Cocos Plates are subducting beneath the South American and Carribean plates. The boundary regions between plates are aptly called plate boundaries. Based upon their motions with respect to one another, these plate boundaries are of three kinds: divergent, convergent, and transform. The northern side is a divergent boundary with the Cocos Plate, the Galapagos Rise.
