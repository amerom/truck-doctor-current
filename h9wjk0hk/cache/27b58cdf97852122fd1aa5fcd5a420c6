Above: In this striking outfit, a blue and white striped shirt with a navy blue blazer is worn with a pair of beige pants. Also pay attention to both her skin tone and her shoe color, which are also shades of beige. That’s a pair of navy blue pants, a white shirt and navy blue knit tie in look #2 and charcoal gray pants, a red chambray shirt and a brown knit tie in look #3. The beige trousers and the white shirt are a perfect match and will give you a chic and elegant style in all circumstances. You’ve got light blue cotton chinos, beige driving loafers, and a crisp white oxford shirt on. Looks #2 and #3 above both feature dark brown blazers. Your skin tone is important. Grey Blazer With Black Trousers But I find grey and beige are good basics and so easy to add any other colour to. But while it may not be the most interesting shade, it makes up for its lack of pizazz with incredible versatility.

Because of their neatness, you can wear the versatile chinos with casual shirts, long sleeve polos and crew neck jumper for a smart-casual look.
