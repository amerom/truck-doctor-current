This article will focus specifically on AT for individuals with learning disabilities (LD). Training and use of assistive technology must be addressed in the Individual Education Plan (IEP) and is a part of the expanded core curriculum for students who are blind or visually impaired including those with mulitiple disabilities. Importance Of Assistive Technology Devices And Services. Why is assistive technology important for students with disabilities? This offers valuable benefits to the students, their teachers and their peers. This specialized technology promotes independence and decreases the need for other support.
