Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas Medical School at Houston, Houston,Texas. Transcriptome analysis shows that 85% (n= 16774) of all human proteins (n=19670) are detected in epithelial cells and 6081 of these genes show an elevated expression in any epithelial cells compared to other cell type groups. The concept of cell nonautonomy in the surrounding epithelium is reinforced by evidence that cell shape , the cytoskeleton [10,11], and cell signaling pathways are altered in the neighbor cells—often reflecting the biochemical symmetry breaking described earlier—and these changes may be confined to the local environment of the extruded cells (only one or a few cell diameters away). Both apoptotic and live cell extrusion from epithelial overcrowding require the same S1P-S1P 2-Rho signaling pathway. Regeneration is the process whereby denuded portions of epithelium-lined surfaces (i.e., airways and alveoli) are repaired. Gudipaty, Swapna Aravind; Rosenblatt, Jody (2017) Epithelial cell extrusion: Pathways and pathologies. Cells can be extruded during apoptosis 3, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 4, or precancerous cell invasion 5, making cell extrusion a key player in … This study examined constitutive and induced expression of CCL28 by A549 human airway epithelial-like cells. To understand which of these cells required caveolae for effective extrusion we employed mixing experiments that depleted CAV1 in selected Cell extrusion is critical for promoting cell death in epithelia: disrupting it causes epithelial masses to form at crowded regions where cells should have extruded . The guinea-pig tympanic membrane was used to study epithelial migration by using an ink-dot staining technique. While the pathways regulating apoptosis and cell extrusion are rather well described 1,2, what regulates the precise spatio-temporal distribution of cell elimination in tissues remains largely unknown.This is particularly relevant for epithelia with high rates of cell elimination, a widespread situation during embryogenesis 3–6 and epithelial homeostasis 7, where concomitant … 656 enriched genes. As recent reviews have highlighted the role of cell extrusion in barrier function against pathogens The asymmetric boundary between a transformed epithelial cell and surrounding normal counterparts is yet to be characterized, and its importance in cell extrusion is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the signal produced by dying cells to initiate this process is sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). 2014. Live cell extrusion is the paradigm for homeostatic renewal of intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). The normal tympanic membrane exhibited clear-cut migratory pathways, mainly in a superior direction. The nuclei of periderm cells extruding in Hai1a-deficient embryos were not grossly fragmented. Epithelial cell extrusion and subsequent apoptosis is a key mechanism to prevent the accumulation of excess cells. Main function: Barrier, secretion and absorption. Measles virus (MeV) is highly infectious by the respiratory route, but respiratory epithelial cells are thought to be resistant to infection through the exposed apical surface and to require infection through the basolateral surface. Lubkov, Veronica, and Dafna Bar-Sagi. Discovery of Piezo1 as a channel that senses stretch (cell loss) in epithelial sheets, and then promotes proliferation to add cell numbers. p120 Catenin Suppresses Basal Epithelial Cell Extrusion in Invasive Pancreatic Neoplasia ... as one of 12 core signaling pathways (1). 1003 group enriched genes. Key inducers of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition process. Epithelial to mesenchymal cell transition – loss of cell adhesion leads to constriction and extrusion of newly mesenchymal cell. Loss of E-cadherin is considered to be a fundamental event in EMT. An international collaboration has revealed how epithelial cell extrusion is regulated by cell density. (2015) Defective apical extrusion signaling contributes to aggressive tumor hallmarks. 2017. Figure: Cell extrusion mechanisms at different cell density. At low density, apoptotic cells are extruded by cell crawling and lamellipodia, while purse-string contraction drives extrusion at high density. Credit: National University of Singapore An international collaboration has revealed how epithelial cell extrusion is regulated by cell density. epithelium. Abstract. One was apical cell extrusion that was matriptase- and Par2b-dependent. It is a special form of extracellular matrix that you can find surrounding cells, under sheets of cells or between sheets of cells. Indeed, because epithelial cells naturally turn over by cell death and division at some of the highest rates in the body, epithelia depend on crowding-induced live cell extrusion to preserve constant cell numbers. O'Donoghue GM. The newly proliferated stem cells in the crypt regions differentiate into epithelial cells with high expression of brush border enzymes and transporters, and concurrently migrate upward to the Decreasing S1P synthesis by inhibiting sphingosine kinase Concurrently, strain also changes the metastatic phenotype of newly transformed cells by … The timing of extrusion was variable but was complete in the majority of embryos by 60 hpf (Figure 1C). Extrusion occurs by cells destined to die signalling to surrounding epithelial cells to contract an actomyosin ring that squeezes the dying cell out 4, 5, 6. However, it is not clear what drives cell death during normal homeostasis. “Epithelial Cell Extrusion: Pathways and Pathologies.” Seminars in Cell & Developmental Biology 67 (July): 132–40. Epithelial cells can secrete the basal lamina, which is a layer that can provide support and help separate cells while acting like a filter. Loss of epithelial cell polarity is a hallmark of cancer cells that correlates with tumor aggressiveness. The physiology of epithelial cell loss at the villus tip was historically viewed as a simple passive process of epithelial sloughing of individual cells or clusters of cells. Abstract. Maintaining Epithelial Barriers. On the basis of our previous work, we had hypothesized that the exocyst was involved in the maintenance of renal epithelial barrier integrity ( 23 ). The study was published in the scientific journal Current Biology on 5 October 2016. When we trigger apoptosis in epithelia, dying cells are extruded to preserve a functional barrier 4. “E-Cadherin-Mediated Cell Coupling Is Required for Apoptotic Cell Extrusion.” Current Biology: CB 24 (8): 868–74. Purpose of review: Both apoptotic and nonapoptotic cell extrusion preserve the barrier functions of epithelia. Inflammasomes and Their Soluble Mediators in Intestinal Homeostasis Gudipaty, Swapna Aravind, and Jody Rosenblatt. Semin Cell Dev Biol 67:132-140 Gu, Yapeng; Shea, Jill; Slattum, Gloria et al. Indeed, because epithelial cells naturally turn over by cell death and division at some of the highest rates in the body, epithelia depend on crowding-induced live cell extrusion to preserve constant cell numbers. Live cell extrusion is the paradigm for homeostatic renewal of intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). Apical extrusion arises from the interaction between oncogene-expressing cells and the non-transformed cells of the surrounding epithelium (Hogan et al., 2009; Kajita et al., 2014). Extrusion, therefore, is essential to regulate cell density during epithelial homeostasis, and, when defective, it may compromise epithelial barrier function or lead to other pathologies (5, 27). In contrast to dying cell extrusion, which requires an apoptotic stimulus to generate S1P, crowding-induced live cell extrusion requires the stretch-activated channel Piezo-1 (Figure 1B) [2,9]. Additionally, inhibition of epithelial cell extrusion blocks cell death even in response to harsh apoptotic stimuli, suggesting that extrusion is necessary for promoting both natural and induced epithelial cell death by countering the survival signaling associated with cell … EMT …  turnover rates of intestinal epithelial cells (enterocytes) are governed by the pace of crypt cell proliferation and villus/surface cell shedding. Cyclic strain impedes the apical extrusion of Ras V12 cells from the healthy monolayer and prevents the formation of strong circumferential belts of actin in Ras V12 cells. Here, we discuss how defects in the ability to sense and respond to cellular crowding may promote common epithelial … Epithelial cells, unlike other cell types such as fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells, migrate as sheets of cells with modified intercellular junction associations. Live extruded cells resulting from a crowding stimulus die after expulsion from the rest of the … Epithelial migration on the guinea-pig tympanic membrane: the influence of perforation and ventilating tube insertion. The epithelial–mesenchymal transition is a process by which epithelial cells lose their cell polarity and cell–cell adhesion, and gain migratory and invasive properties to become mesenchymal stem cells; these are multipotent stromal cells that can differentiate into a variety of cell types. CK19 quantification. Both apoptotic and nonapoptotic cell extrusion preserve the barrier functions of epithelia. By extension, as extruded cells are not apoptotic, this form of cell shedding is thought to be largely ignored by lamina propria phagocytes and without immune consequence. dying cells by extrusion. Dr. Nusrat’s group found that lamellipodia of migrating intestinal epithelial cells are enriched in actin filaments and actin modifying proteins, villin and gelsolin. Removal of these apoptotic cells from the epithelial cell sheet to maintain an intact barrier layer takes place by the process of cell extrusion. To date, studies have shown that epithelial cell extrusion occurs via formation of a contractile ring made up of protein based cables and motors in the cells surrounding the cell targeted for extrusion. Epithelia can extrude out cells targeted to die by apoptotic stimuli to repair the barrier in the face of death or extrude live cells to promote cell death when epithelial cells become too crowded. For example, detachment of adherent epithelial cell line cells and IECs has been reported to lead to a Bcl-2 family-member-dependent form of cell death (e.g. For quantification of CK19 + basal cell extrusion, CK19 + cells (excluding apically extruded CK19 + cells and normal pancreatic ducts) were counted in 1 scanned section per animal. 6081 elevated genes. (Figure 1D). Two distinct forms of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) extrusions have been previously reported in the mammalian intestine 1: 1 mediated by apoptosis with preserved barrier function 2, 3 and the second form of cell extrusion described as cell death reminiscent of necrosis that was associated with compromised epithelial integrity. Polarity proteins are often deregulated in cancers (14, 15). The change in cell fate is under the control of the Notch signalling pathway. Once the epithelium becomes necrotic or ulcerated, the adjacent, viable epithelial cells replace the lost cells. ), cell extrusion can exert positive or negative effects on organismal health. Consequently, it is a candidate mediator of the pathology associated with asthma. The epithelial cells on either side of the CS cells eventually met at 42 hpf in most ani-mals, followed by extrusion of the CS gland from the tubule (Figure 1A and Video 1). Here, we show in a model system how mechanical stretch in epithelial sheets results in a more invasive phenotype in transformed cells. Because extrusion appears to be critical for regulating overall cell numbers during epithelial homeostasis, alterations of any step in pathway controlling cell extrusion could lead to epithelial pathologies that either disrupt barrier function or lead to hyperplasia and cancer . The process of CS formation can be divided into two steps: the initial transdifferentiation of the DE cells into CS cells and the subsequent extrusion of the CS cells from the renal epithelium. Dysregulated cell extrusion adversely impacts epithelia homeostasis through two main pathologies, tumorigenesis and bacterial invasion. By contrast, when driven by oncogene expression, apical cell extrusion is followed by proliferation and represents an initial step of tumorigenesis. Epithelia can extrude out cells targeted to die by apoptotic stimuli to repair the barrier in the face of death or extrude live cells to promote cell death when epithelial cells become too crowded. Classically, apical cell extrusion from an epithelium is triggered by apoptosis, damage, or cell crowding (Eisenhoffer et al., 2012; Gudipaty and Rosenblatt, 2017). This is also called the basement membrane . During extrusion, a cell destined for apoptosis signals its neighboring cells to form and contract a ring of actin and myosin, which squeezes the dying cell out of the epithelium.
