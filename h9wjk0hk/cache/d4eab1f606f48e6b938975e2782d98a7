Re-estimate to see the most up-to-date info. There are 5 daily trains from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara. The days of stepping into an Uber, Lyft or taxi curbside at Los Angeles International Airport are over. I will add that it is risky to travel in … Our prices include a licensed driver and vehicle, taxes and toll charges, luggage and extras such as child seats and ski equipment, waiting time and flight monitoring. We hope you find it easy to navigate. Prices were available within the past 7 days and starts at $87 for one-way flights and $163 for round trip, for the period specified. The fastest bus normally takes 2h 10m. The only service that is not currently allowed at LAX is UberPOOL (for pickups only — drop-offs allowed).
