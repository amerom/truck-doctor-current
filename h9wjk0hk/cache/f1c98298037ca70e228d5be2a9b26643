PLACE HOT MIX ASPHALT … The intent is to enable Caltrans to optimize the use of asphalt rubber materials to obtain the advertised benefits. Rubberized asphalt--asphalt cement modified with CRM that may include less than 15 percent CRM by mass and thus may not comply with the ASTM definition of asphalt rubber (ASTM D 8, Vol. As these RHMA layers reach the end of their design ASPHALT BINDER (GEOSYNTHETIC PAVEMENT INTERLAYER) (ENGMET) 394072. asphalt rubber chip seal,» Chip Seal & Cape Seal Chip Seal is a comparatively low-cost method of maintaining an asphalt surface indefinitely that can make use of local materials, and be performed by contract or by using local maintenance personnel. The good news is that due to the passage of AB 1843 (Escutia — Chapter 838, Statutes of 2000) and the establishment of the Tire Recycling Management Act, the California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) is leading the way in the effort to recycle tire materials. With usage of rubber asphalt products for over 20 years, the California public roadway agencies experience a 20% savings to roadway construction and repair and have over 22,000 lane miles of rubberized asphalt roads in service. Rubberized asphalt is currently the pavement of choice by CalTrans. Common types of flexible pavement include hot mix asphalt (HMA), rubberized hot mix asphalt-gap graded (RHMA-G), and open graded friction course (OGFC). CALIFORNIA 1978 CALTRANS research concluded that "…interlayers having a rubber asphalt backing (…Polyguard) do not weaken in shear by embrittlement at low temperatures (down to –20°F)" (Evaluation of Pavement Fabric Test Installations in California, undated, p.10) The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has been using scrap tire rubber in asphalt pavements since the 1970s in chip seals and the 1980s in rubberized hot mix asphalt (RHMA). asphalt concrete mixes, and using reclaimed conventional asphalt pavement (RAP) materials as partial binder and aggregate replacement in new gap-graded asphalt rubber mixes. 4.03). Caltrans began experimenting with rubberized asphalt produced by the “wet process” in the 1970s and developed design criteria using roadway deflection testing that resulted in thinner overlay courses than conventional asphalt concrete. Rubberized Asphalt Concrete Rubberized AC is AC with approximately 1 to 2 percent ground "crumb rubber" from dewired tires or other rubber sources, by weight of mix. The particular binder was a PG70-22TR and needed no special equipment for placement and compaction. With usage of rubber asphalt products for over 20 years, the California public roadway agencies experience a 20% savings to roadway construction and repair and have over 22,000 lane miles of rubberized asphalt roads in service.

The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has been using scrap tire rubber in asphalt pavements since the 1970s in chip seals and the 1980s in Rubberized Asphalt Concrete (RAC). The first project using RAC was constructed in 1978 and since then Caltrans has had considerable experience with RAC. Caltrans has established that using Asphalt Rubber Chip Seal provides the equivalent service life as a 2.4 inch conventional hot mix asphalt overlay (See Appendix B, attached). Common types of flexible pavement include hot mix asphalt (HMA), rubberized hot mix asphalt-gap graded (RHMA-G), and open-graded friction course (OGFC). Yes you read correctly, small chunks of rubber. Caltrans Reviews Rubberized Chip Seals. The Strawberry project was an emergency repair to a dramatically failed pavement. There are also two types of rubberized OGFC mixes: rubberized hot mix asphalt-open graded (RHMA-O) and RHMA-O-high-binder (RHMA-O-HB). Its specially-blended, high-tack rubberized asphalt compound is compatible with all common pavement surfaces such as asphalt … rubber modifier (scrap tire crumb rubber and high natural crumb rubber). Caltrans’ public information officer Phil Frisbie, Jr. said there are about 3 weeks remaining on the Caltrans contract, which requires a different type of rubberized blend and a “plant reconfiguration” was necessary for the “open porous” blend required for the asphalt’s top layer. Bruce Rymer, Senior Engineer for Caltrans, says that open-graded or rubberized asphalt pavements have shown the best performance on the roads tested in California.
