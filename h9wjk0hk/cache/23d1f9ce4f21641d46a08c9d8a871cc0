The second section outlines the research methodology adopted by this study. They found broadly consistent patterns across these regions, including a marked increase in crop diversity in the 1970s-80s but an overall homogenisation of global crop species pools. Crop diversification, that aims at replacing water guzzling paddy- cultivated on over 85 percent of the cropped land with less water-intensive crops, is being proposed as a strategy to overcome the groundwater crisis in Punjab. The social benefits of diversification have received relatively little attention while its agronomic and economic benefits are well known. Conclusion Crop diversification is not only a shift from traditional and less remunerative crops to more remunerative crops but it is a demand driven, need based situation specific and national goal seeking continuous and dynamic concept and involves spatial, temporal, value addition and resource complementary approaches. This is one of the few near-term targets of the SDGs, making it truly urgent to achieve this goal but also very plausible if we all work together. 13 synonyms for diversification: diverseness, diversity, heterogeneity, heterogeneousness, miscellaneousness, multifariousness, multiformity, multiplicity....

IV.  TOPICS: Crops. Intercropping leads to diversified farming systems, providing multiple sources of income for the farmers. Our objectives like natural resources sustainability, ecological balance, output growth, employment generation, risk coverage can be attained through following crop diversification which aims to increase total productivity in terms of quality, quantity and monetary value under specific, diverse agro-climatic situations worldwide. An approach towards solving this problem is crop diversification and the optimized use of resources. Two latest studies have been conducted recently. Diversification includes rotating to other crops, double cropping and intercropping. This was advocated to the farmers for two main reasons. The conference explored how we can achieve the full potential of cropping system diversification for improved productivity, delivery of ecosystem services and resource-efficient and sustainable value chains. Crops such as fruit & vegetables can be used to make preserves, powders etc. BENEFITS OF FOOD CROP DIVERSIFICATION FOR POVERTY ALLEVIATION The concept of agricultural diversification initially stems from the search for a means to reduce risk in terms of individual farm income risk and regional food supply risk. But adopting such sustainable agriculture initiatives on a larger scale requires interest from both food producers and consumers. One possible solution is crop diversification. Diversification benefits of FX style investments are more pronounced if we apply the optimal hedge or the full hedge to the benchmark assets, as shown by the center and bottom panels of Table II. livestock, crop pests, and diseases, culminating into food insecurity. Economically, crop mix diversification can mitigate risk. In 2018, raw cotton accounted for 34.5% of Benin’s export revenue . Based upon data from over 15 000 operations, it was determined that individual farms have become more specialized in their cropping patterns since 1994, and this trend is unlikely to change in the immediate future, notwithstanding anticipated climate change and the known risk-reducing benefits of crop diversification. “Across many different countries in many different climates and soils, with many different crops, the general pattern is that with diversification, you maintain or increase crop yields while gaining environmental benefits.” Agriculture in the Midwest is dominated by just a few crops… Tillage practices alter the magnitude of crop diversity benefits in abnormal years. Crop diversification, however, differs significantly from crop rotation: The crop diversification measure proposed states that a farmer must have three different crops on his or her land, with no crop covering more than 70%, or less than 5%, of the total arable area. In 2018, raw cotton accounted for 34.5% of Benin’s export revenue .
