Course, Success Point IAS The impact of Sea breeze rapidly declines landward and impact is limited to 50km. Sirocco winds are known as Levech in Spain and Leste in Morocco and Madeira, Gibli in Lybia, Chilli in Tunisia.                       Civil Engineering Course by Engineers Career Group, Geography Optional for UPSC Mains by He will explain about local winds, katabatc winds and foehn winds. The local winds are formed on a small spatial scale. Sea Breeze brings cool marine air and thus helps in moderation of coastal temperature and due to the sea breeze, coastal regions record a drop of 5-10. Thus, they are more localized in their extent and cover limited horizontal and vertical dimensions and confined to the lower levels of the troposphere. There are many local winds around the globe. In Eurasia, they are called the Steppes, and stretch eastwards from the shores of the Black Sea to the foothills of the Altai Mountains. Such Blizzards are of common occurrence in the Antarctic and here the wind velocity may even reach up to 160km/hr. Sum up the answer in short and crisp conclusion.                                                             Criteria, SSC CGL Foehn is dry and warm wind resulting due to adiabatic heating on the leeward side of the Mountain range. NOTES WINDS Light breeze is a wind with a speed of from 7 to 11 kilometers per hour, Fresh breeze is a wind with a speed of from 31 to 39 kilometers per hour and Gale is a wind with a speed of from 63 to 74 kilometers per hour.. Due to rotation of the earth, in the Northern hemisphere winds are deflected to their right and in Southern hemisphere to their left.

They are the result of adiabatic heating which occurs due to downslope compression on the leeward side, as the mountain barrier creates frictional drag which tends to pull the air from the higher level down on the leeward and air forced down is heated adiabatically and at the same time its relative humidity is also lowered. These are cold and dry north-easterly winds that blow from the mountains towards the eastern shore of the Adriatic Sea.
