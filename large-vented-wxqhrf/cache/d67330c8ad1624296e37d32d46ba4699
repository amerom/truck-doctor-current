The guidelines don't seem to offer any wiggle room here: "Packages may only build with an alternative compiler to gcc if upstream does not support gcc.". I for one was not aware at how many of the security protections in GCC were not available in clang. And nobody is being "locked in", nobody forces Fedora to choose GCC, this is a deliberate choice. That unfortunately means extra maintenance for us to keep gcc fixes up-to date. In addition to supporting our site through advertisements, you can help by subscribing to Phoronix Premium. - Issue close_status updated to: Accepted qemu is much slower when built with clang vs gcc: Date: Mon, 24 Aug 2020 16:54:01 +0000: We’re seeing significant slowdowns when we build qemu with clang instead of gcc. (Clang lags significantly behind GCC on security hardening.) I don't see any restrictions on using clang in the guidelines - what is the concern that would need FESCo approval? Metadata Update from @cverna: He also notes that it is just hard to reproduce the "official builds" whatever compiler you do use. The clang vs gcc android emulator emulators used to provide a button for this, but such buttons were shown only in a specific skin: Skin with dynamic hardware controls. So why should we allow such an unfair privilege to this package? All rights reserved. (Typical Microsoft ). - Issue status updated to: Closed (was: Open), Metadata Update from @stransky: You can directly compare fedora firefox builds with binaries provided by mozilla. Clang's C++11 mode can be used with libc++ or with gcc… clang is a compiler wrapper for C language family. MOZ_PGO should make more difference than LTO, assuming the train run is reasonable. +1 to "an exception to use clang until gcc is fixed.". Clang's command-line interface is similar to and shares many flags and options with GCC. Can you be more specific which security features are missing and ideally file a #BZ for that with details? As a side note, I've proposed the bugzillas as prioritized bugs. That results in features coming out slower than in GCC and Clang. Frankly, for a piece of the OS as critical as Firefox (for many users, it's the only application they use regularly), I think an exception for a significant performance increase is warranted. In general llvm seems to miss things like variable tracking assignment. that for testing. or the linker flags -z relro, -z defs and -z now. Once Honza's work filters down to the compiler that is released in Fedora, things might change again. Chip vendors, mainly including Intel, ARM, AMD, and IBM (PowerPC). It can store it’s AST on disk then read it. From what I've gathered so far I need something like: Sign in to view. [PATCH v3 0/5] Vs clang-10 and gcc-9 warnings, Richard Henderson <= [PATCH v3 1/5] fpu/softfloat: Silence 'bitwise negation of boolean expression' warning, Richard Henderson, 2020/06/17. The produced DWARF data is not complete enough for the debuginfo package generation, as configured in Fedora, to work. Yet it’s a clear violation of C99′s paragraph 7.26.3. We're also going to use gcc on second arches platforms where clang is not well supported yet. ac_add_options --enable-lto Support for C++ also progressed quickly. CC @tibbs. Ubuntu 19.10 was running on this 32-core / 64-thread high-end system. Such a change has no business ending up in a security update to a released distribution, ever. I don't think gcc is inferior to clang. Japanese brands such as TAKAHIROMIYASHITA an HSA-eligible health insurance policy 2018 Income Tax Returns. That's my thinking too. The comparison is correct for what it compares: Firefox upstream binaries vs. Firefox Fedora binaries. On Wed, 2018-12-12 at 09:45 +0000, Martin Stransky wrote: To be clear here, the next security Firefox update is still going to I am pretty certain that the decision came from FESCo as FPC wouldn't have undertaken a restriction of that magnitude on its own. Clang/LLVM and GCC Community GCC Community In addition to that, there are security issues (llvm doesn't implement e.g. Plain clang build is ~5% faster than the gcc one. We just need a bit more input to know. Currently, only gcc, clang, and variants of those, are probeable. clang vs gcc diagnostic flags 28 Jun 2019. 6% object size increase just from the warning text additions). The resolution was to "allow" clang to be used, not to mandate it. Actually we still use gcc for Firefox 64 and I'm going to switch to clang only if it proves to be better for the Fedora builds. No other changes were made to the system besides switching out the kernel built under each compiler. I have a feeling that Clang is better tested than GCC. This patch makes a change in Clang so that when you use the GCC attribute spelling, the attribute is automatically available in all three spellings by default. We're going to produce testing clang builds after that for testing. I feel that the recent interest of gcc folks in Firefox is driven by the clang competitor and if Firefox is vendor-locked again nothing will be improved. That's my thinking too. _D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 properly) and as mentioned above debuginfo issues. If you switch to a different compiler (which I think should not be done at all given the negative feedback from the toolchain maintainers), this is a major change that should only be done in Rawhide. Allegedly, the code base is really old, and has only started getting "refreshed" in earnest in the past few years (post C++11). Ubuntu 19.10 was running on this 32-core / 64-thread high-end system. I'd like to get an exception to use clang until gcc is fixed. Clang is faster than Gcc uses less memory. https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1849165. The system compiler (gcc) makes sure they KEvin, if that can be used for Fedora I'll happily use it - I don't  favor any particular compiler, my goal is to provide the best user experience for Fedora users. To be clear here, the next security Firefox update is still going to be built with gcc. In light of the discussion on this ticket over this week, and in particular the very detailed blog post Honza Hubicka wrote to analyze the performance and security claims, I think it might be good for us to rediscuss this ticket. #2020 Firefox is switching from gcc to clang/llvm Closed: Invalid 2 months ago by cverna. My recall of the history is a bit murky and I'm a bit short on time this morning so I can't provide an easy summary of why we decided to add that language, but it was certainly in the early days of clang being in the distro. In the spec file I see -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks, has that bug been fixed and can this option be dropped, or has it been just disabled without actually trying to fix the codebase? I did the benchmarks on mozilla nightly built directly from mozilla repository, with mozilla default flags without any Fedora specific tweaks, both with clang 7 and gcc 8. and flip clang/pgo switches. That initial support in Linux 5.3 was not without a few issues, but on Linux 5.5 the experience is in great shape with the stable Clang compiler. Using Clang in Visual Studio Code. Benchmarks: Well, it should be compared to what you can achieve in the distro if you build with clang, not to what Mozilla ships, they might not build with -fstack-protector-strong, -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2, -fstack-clash-protection etc. It's not about switch but a temporary workaround until gcc is fixed. MOZ_PGO should do the trick but I failed to produce anything faster with that - there may be some catch here or maybe the profiling data is not correctly used. AST generated by clang is easily understandable. Legal Disclaimer, Privacy Policy | Contact. With that resolved and no new Clang kernel compatibility problems introduced, it was a pleasant experience building Linux 5.5 with Clang simply by adjusting the CC environment variable. - Issue status updated to: Open (was: Closed). There is the issue that clang/llvm doesn't generate asynchronous unwind Metadata Update from @zbyszek: Someone I am not sure this is done when you use an alternative compiler and @kkofler There's a clear benchmark in this particular case. GitHub Gist: instantly share code, notes, and snippets. I think the free competition is important here as the recent status is that Fedora has slow Firefox binaries compared to Mozilla. Figuring out how to handle "mass rebuilds" (and whether full distro rebuilds are even needed for a change to one of the many compilers) would be the main fallout from something like this. The fact is that last time I tried gcc8 + PGO the final binaries crashed and when I removed the problematic parts the final binaries has inferior speed compared to Mozilla ones. For some unknown reason they choose to drop gcc’s front end , and create a new compiler front end from scratch. RHBZ#1495742 talks about PGO, not LTO, so which one it is? The rule to use GCC is not "vendor lock-in", it is there to ensure that the distribution consistently uses the same compiler-level security features, among other things. and tweak probably RPM_OPT_FLAGS in the spec file too. I switched to clang instead of gcc at some point (whenever at least it is possible). This was around the time when I had still worked for Nokia. GCC has dependencies on particular versions of GMP, MPFR, MPC, Parma Polyhedra Library, and CLooG, and I needed several iterations to find the versions which would work for a particular GCC release (yes, using the latest versions of those libraries does not work).           to comment on this ticket. - Issue status updated to: Closed (was: Open). Clang Vs Gcc 2020 You also can browse the consolidated DCCCD CE schedule or und bietet zudem zahlreiche innovative. (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1495742). Closing since the gcc bug was fixed and firefox is still built with gcc. I'm fine with rescinding the exception granted in https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/2020#comment-545724. http://web.basemark.com/. Please advise. ac_add_options --enable-lto Do you have a src.rpm where you enable the clang LTO and PGO? but it's also clear that patches are required to actually get a working binary. DEV is a community of 514,000 amazing developers . The guidelines don't seem to offer any wiggle room here: "Packages may only build with an alternative compiler to gcc if upstream does not support gcc." with clang and -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3D2 isn't implemented properly. If it goes well we don't need to switch to clang at all. Even if somebody else made a different benchmark with a different version of the compiler with different options, doesn't make the first one "false", "wrong", or anything else, except possibly "outdated". unsigned overflow detection -fsanitize=unsigned-integer-overflow – gcc: needed – clang: working! If that option works around something, usually it means calling method on a NULL object or something similarly undefined. I would not insist on "--enable-lto" as it causes run-time firefox crash Clang 3.3 fully supported C++ 11, Clang 3.4 fully supported C++ 14, and Clang 5 fully supported C++ 17, and all were significantly ahead of GCC at that time. You can also contribute to Phoronix through a PayPal tip. But there is no rationale to allow Firefox to do something that no other package in Fedora is allowed to do without a strong reason. Tom Stellard (clang maintainer) has asked me to file this ticket to comply with Fedora processes. Compilation time generally increased relative to Clang 4.0. Not only you are wrong, but also the words you use are unpleasant. All trademarks used are properties of their respective owners. Mozilla upstream switches from gcc to clang and we're going to follow upstream here due to clang performance, maintenance costs and compilation speed. From: : no-reply: Subject: : Re: [PATCH v3 0/5] Vs clang-10 and gcc-9 warnings: Date: : Tue, 16 Jun 2020 22:15:50 -0700 (PDT) Most (if not all) of the security hardening doesn't work in Clang. Years later, though, things are obviously a bit different. But it is not enough to generalize to other programs or the whole distro. Clang came out of apple’s stable and became open sourced in 2007. The one such reason that was brought forward turned out to be false. ac_add_options --enable-optimize="-g -O3" Allowing this only for Firefox is unfair to other web engine implementations (Chromium, QtWebEngine, WebKitGtk, QtWebKit). For packages build with default toolchain rpmbuild makes sure to add Clang implements many GNU language extensions and enables them by default. GCC vs. LLVM Clang Compiler Benchmarks 2019. Jakub works on updated/fixed gcc in Fedora, from my initial testing the builds roughly match the clang performance. The choice of library usually depends on the system being developed for … Some of the security features we enable in Fedora builds are a tradeoff vs. performance, but they are absolutely worth it, especially for an application designed to browse random sites (with JavaScript code) from the entire Internet. While I don't agree that the original decision was made based on "false premises", I do believe that it was made without access to all of the necessary information. What developers Nathan Chancellor and Nathan Huckleberry found were that "GCC always beats LLVM" for 64-bit ARM and x86_64, even when LLVM is compiled with LTO and PGO enabled. - Issue untagged with: meeting, Metadata Update from @sgallagh: But I recommend to take latest nightly and do the tests there as it uses the same flags for gcc/clang and the build/benchmark is easier that with rpm packages. ", Upstream Firefox is more than welcome to make a different choice around security vs. performance, but I for one would rather Fedora be known as "That one OS that didn't get hit by the latest punny security vulnerability. Backgrounds: I need to get the register value in the c code, so I found this in gcc usage.

On the language front, MSVC does lag behind. Ringing In 2020 By Clang'ing The Linux 5.5 Kernel - Benchmarks Of GCC vs. Clang Built Kernels. Especially in Fedora context. As I understand it, the Fedora GCC maintainers are willing to apply any required patches. June 2020: 10.0: In a May 2017 benchmark comparing AOCC v1.0 to Clang 4 and 5, and GCC 6 through 8, Phoronix found AOCC provided significant but modest improvement over Clang 4.0 in several benchmarks and no difference in others. I don't see any evidence so far that switching the compiler is a magic wand to gain 10-20% performance without compromising part of the security. the default system toolchain. =20 GCC’s main popularity lies in the fact that it … 0\Apps\android-ndk-r10\ clang vs gcc android emulator still exists and contains the only clang vs gcc android emulator clang. using too much memory/changed code generation/crashed the compiler.

I don't see any issues with clang/debuginfo on my test builds, works normally in gdb. Then we can talk about gcc performance, I'll happily revert the change and build it with gcc with your setup. Honza Hubicka is currently testing if -fno-semantics-interposition (the default behavior of clang, but not of gcc) doesn't affect significantly the non-LTO builds. ac_add_options MOZ_PGO=1 But it has to be made at the level of the whole distribution (Fedora) and not by every single package (and especially not by the maintainers of one package with a special exception for that one package only). Please use the Fedora Firefox package and produce faster binaries than the ones which are shipped by Mozilla. 05 February 2019. @jlaw Can you comment on the Tools team's position on switching Firefox to clang? Not only you are wrong, but also the words you use are unpleasant. current status. Nothing from gcc, nothing from clang, nothing from sparse. Yes, MOZ_PGO enables PGO builds which should bring more significant performance boost. I agree that it needs to be reconsidered. We also use mozilla crash reported and submit debug symbols to mozilla so we don't depend much on Fedora Abrt. See https://blog.mozilla.org/nfroyd/2018/05/29/when-implementation-monoculture-right-thing/#comment-2809 for details, GCC actually with LTO/PGO creates smaller and faster Firefox. For example, even though Clang implements atomic intrinsics which correspond exactly with C11 atomics, it also implements GCC's __sync_* intrinsics for … Login In Fedora -fstack-clash-protection is a no-op on clang. I think it's pretty clear, but I'll repeat it: the benchmark compared firefox as it was in Fedora then with the upstream binary. It's not a guideline so I'm not bothered by the wording. We're going to produce testing clang builds after Perhaps this should be raised with the Fedora packaging committee instead of FESCo, since they oversee the packaging guidelines. Thus Clang is born . - Issue status updated to: Closed (was: Open), Metadata Update from @zbyszek: code: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Toolchain/Watermark. You can take this package: In my view, the valid considerations that weren't brought forth before voting were the following: Please stop repeating that "one such reason that was brought forward turned out to be false" and "this exception was granted based on false premises". Do you have a src.rpm where you enable the clang LTO and PGO? It's great to hear that @stransky is open to switching back later. To me, this looks like clear evidence that this exception was granted based on false premises: The claimed 10% performance gain was the one argument that swayed the decision in favor of granting the exception, but this benchmark shows that GCC-built binaries are actually faster on all benchmarks: one single benchmark (JetStream) is won by the old GCC 6, all the others by GCC 8. Similar to how GCC supports __attribute__((foo)) as [[gnu::foo]] in C++ mode, it now supports the same spelling in C mode as well. https://browserbench.org It seems that depending on which benchmark Sure.

I am not aware of something similar for llvm. Command Tips ; 1. I would wager that part of it was to avoid the "ooo, shiny" effect (which is closely related to the "-O9 because fasterer" effect. Debuginfo generation with Clang is broken. https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines#Compiler. For GCC there is extensive documentation how/if certain optimization - Issue close_status updated to: Invalid MOZ_PGO should make more difference than LTO, assuming the train run is reasonable. This comment has been minimized. Environment. in clang were known or not when the decision was made. warrant giving up some of the features and compatibility with Phoronix Premium allows ad-free access to the site, multi-page articles on a single page, and other features while supporting this site's continued operations. Note that Honza uses OpenSUSE and I was not able to replicate his setup/results on Fedora. I haven't looked recently at the debuginfo that llvm generates, but in That's perhaps something from the past and can be removed. The last time I looked into using clang to build stuff in Fedora (two years ago), the debuginfo generated by it was pretty broken (debuginfo stuff was missing enough things that debugsource subpackages would not generate properly). you look at one or the other compiler produces smaller and - Clang - missing C++20 - feature - lambda expression in an unevaluated operand - GCC: error: types may not be defined in 'decltype' expressions - … Recently, I've been compiling some of the codebases I work on under Clang 3.8 instead of GCC 4.8, to take advantage of better compiler warnings and faster compilation speed (I've seen a 33% speedup, though I haven't tested this rigorously). The situation is here again and even in worse state. What @stransky is asking for is an exception, which requires FESCo approval. ac_add_options --enable-tests Clang for Objective-C cloud be fully used for the production environment in 2009.

Clang vs GCC vs MSVC - which one is correct? AFAIK yes, they use it for some memory/sanity testing. Did you have --enable-tests and X server? backtraces by various tools. +1. Mozilla uses clang as a default compiler for Firefox so it's expected to work as Mozilla fixes all related bugs there. 1495742 talks about PGO, not LTO, so which one it is? Did you have --enable-tests and X server? Please stop repeating that "one such reason that was brought forward turned out to be false" and "this exception was granted based on false premises". Thus, this exception has no valid basis and hence ought to be rescinded. You can use Clang in C++11 mode with the -std=c++11 option. +1 to reverting the exception in this case, Metadata Update from @bowlofeggs: in clang were known or not when the decision was made. tables on all architectures (.eh_frame), which impacts generating And CLang vs GCC Posted Dec 24, 2016 17:38 UTC (Sat) by karkhaz ( supporter , #99844) [ Link ] Clang comes with several tools (like Clang Formatter, the Clang Static Analyzer, libfuzzer, and the Saninitizers) which are really nice to have around. As it stands right now, GCC is faster than Clang at compiling the Linux kernel. Firefox in Fedora must be built with the distro compiler, so right now clang works better. On the library front, MSVC implements and releases new features at about the same rate as GCC and Clang. So we might not even know which security hardening features are There are only 2 possibilities: either Clang is really so much better than GCC, then it should become the preferred compiler distro-wide (and GCC used only for those packages that don't build with Clang), or it is not, then we should consistently stick to GCC. Then we could see if that speed difference is big enough to Clang 3.3 and later implement all of the ISO C++ 2011 standard. It is a valid comparison. Firefox is a very important and widely used program, and 10-20% speedup is not something to be sniffed at. The mission at Phoronix since 2004 has centered around enriching the Linux hardware experience. To me, this looks like clear evidence that this exception was granted based on false premises: The claimed 10% performance gain was the one argument that swayed the decision in favor of granting the exception, but this benchmark shows that GCC-built binaries are actually faster on all benchmarks: one single benchmark (JetStream) is won by the old GCC 6, all the others by GCC 8. I'd like to have free hands to use the best compiler available and not to be restricted by one of them to produce the best binaries for our users. Is the src.rpm setup to be able to run the tests during build (against Xvfb)? But I don't believe those can make so huge performance difference. Written by Michael Larabel in Software on 31 As it stands right now, GCC is faster than Clang at compiling the Linux kernel. It seems strange that the C/C++ guidelines wouldn't mention this. That's sad to hear. with both the system compiler and the alternative compiler I get the ebp value using the following code.

If we could to have (scratch) builds of the package done @stransky, does upstream still plan to support gcc? gs.md. Can we add it to Monday's agenda? In general, this sounds like a mistake to allow Firefox to transition from GCC to Clang. missing.

Judging from the evidence gathered so far, there are 2 likely possible outcomes: either the GCC binaries will be approximately the same speed if not slightly faster, or the Clang binaries will only be faster for one reason: missing security features. From what I've gathered so far I need something like: VS produces code that is 1.5-2x slower than gcc and clang windows 10.0 visual studio 2017 version 15.6 preview Patrik Huber reported Feb 07, 2018 at 11:51 AM From the linked blog note, it's clear that gcc is improving and is a viable competitor, but it's also clear that patches are required to actually get a working binary. The speed difference is about 10-20%, mainly due to PGO/LTO.
