While there is no SAAMI rating for the max pressure the .338 LM can handle, the European CIP rating is 60,916psi though with their safety standards; this means they safely fired the cartridge at psi’s over 75,000psi. If you compare individual rounds, the flattest .338 LM round shows nearly 40″ less bullet drop at 600 rounds compared to the steepest falling .308 Win round and 56″ less drop at 700 yards. 338 LM Federal MatchKing BTHP Gold Medal 250gr, 338 LM Nosler Trophy Grade AccuBond 300gr, 308 Federal Vital-Shok Ballistic Tip 150gr. I guess which one you choose depends on what you plan on doing with it._____ treeman . Soon afterwâ¦ This includes recoil, trajectory, and terminal ballistics such as penetration and bullet expansion. Research Armament Industries (RAI) started the initial development of the cartridge in 1983. We compiled the bullet energy data from each rounds manufacturer and have put them in a graph following them out to the 500-yard mark (Graph 7). The reason why penetration is essential is it determines the rounds ability to reach critical organs. The .308 rounds have a muzzle energy ranging from 2600 to 2900ft.lb. So I get that the .338 concept fits a niche. But, that slight edge comes at a steep price. You can get 338 Lapua rounds as light as 225 and 210 grains, which can help reduce the damage to your prey. This trend continues downrange to the 500-yard mark though we do see some variance in the amount of energy with the .338 LM rounds. At the 200 yard mark, all of the ten rounds are clustered tightly around the 3-4” mark. It’s easier to calculate the bullet drop and make adjustments when the bullet’s trajectory is more of a straight line than a rainbow. While the .338 LM and even the .308 Win are known long range rounds, they are both also used in hunting situations where shots within 300 yards are often encountered. While there is some overlap in the applications of these rounds, there are also going to be certain shooting situations where one â¦ First, there is no single type of data that we can compare between two cartridges that give us a definitive answer for the differences in stopping power. This is not the same as the felt recoil or the actual kick you will feel because other factors such as stance and firearm characteristics such as weight, stock design, and muzzle brakes all influence the felt recoil and can’t be accounted for in this article. And we mean long, long-range shooting. Recoil on my 338 LM rifle is surprisingly tame with a muzzle brake. They happen to be the components that we can put numbers too for comparing two cartridges. The table shows that the 338 RUM delivers equal velocities with less powder and less recoil up through the 250 Grain bullets. In the early days, the .338 lapua sniper cartridge was made to ground itself on a .378 Weatherby case, but was soon altered for more precision and penetration power. With 300 grain bullets, the win mag throws them at â¦ But, understand that if you use 338 Lapua for hunting at short ranges or on smaller animals, you’re going to lose a lot of meat. We hope you get the chance to experiment with both of these cartridges and all the different ammunition options that are out there. But where that extra powder and weight come in handy is at extreme distances. However, the 338 Lapua does offer a slight edge over many of the competing rounds, either in terms of terminal ballistics or in-flight path ballistics. 94 30-30 if I am close quarters woods. Most hunters look for at least 1,000ft.lb of kinetic energy when dealing with whitetail size game. A 300 win mag vs 338 lapua might be more comparable. Like the velocity, the ballistic coefficient also influences many other categories. I am not saying the 338 cannot shoot well. If you remember the cartridge specs we looked at earlier in the article, you can also see that a lot more material has to be used for the .338 rounds. If you do not have the proper rifle twist, you can have the hottest load in the world and be wildly off target. The .308 Winchester was introduced in 1952 and soon after the casing was modified and adopted as the 7.62x51mm NATO round that saw action in Vietnam. Unless you are highly trained in the use of the rifle and have logged a couple hundred hours, the recoil of the .338 Lapua Magnum is going to be in the back of your mind when lining up a shot. When you look at the two cartridges together, you think to yourself, âwell thatâs not that far off. Mdl. However, the price point reserves this round for the most dedicated hunters and shooters. I use a Win. Some of the other properties for determining stopping power include the expansion properties of the bullet and wound creation, which is tough for cartridge comparison purposes, and even shot placement. And, it’s a very versatile round, despite being overpowered for some shooting contexts. The .338 LM can take much heavier bullets than a .308 casing, and the increased capacity and design of the casing allows the .338 LM to have a max case capacity double the .308 which would be needed to have the correct ballistics to be a useful cartridge. Like the example, all of the components that go into stopping power coalesce into a round that can either drop game cleanly or it can’t. This cartridge is much younger when compared to the other cartridge we will look at, but it is interesting because it is sometimes seen as a replacement for the .308 Win in specific shooting applications. It is even capable of taking larger game within 200 yards. Most of us don’t need armor penetration, let alone armor penetration at 1000 yards. And given that the .308 rounds are generating around 20ft.lb of energy, which is considered as being enough recoil to influence a shot or cause discomfort to some, you get an idea of how powerful a round the .338 LM is. You pay a lot to get that additional performance. Ruger â Precision Rifle 26â³ MSR Stock. By looking at a wider selection of rounds with varying loads, bullet designs, and weights, we can see if this trend is more general towards the cartridges. The one and only â .338 Lapua Magnum The .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge, or .338 Lapua Mag or .338 LM for short, is the ultimate centerfire rifle cartridge, purpose-built specifically for extremely long ranges. This same idea goes for terminal ballistics as well. The .338 Lm is a perfectly fine elk cartridge especially for shots at 400+ yards but even then and definitely at shorter distances, it’s probably overkill, and the weight of the rifle is going to be an issue for most people and most hunting situations that require a lot of hiking. Sierra Partition HPBT for all the rest. Recently Added Ammo. As far as ballistics go, you’re looking at a ballistic coefficient of 0.789 with only a little over 100 inches of bullet drop at 700 yards. We will take an in depth look at the 338 Lapua vs 308 and hopefully come out on the other side with a better understanding of both. Designed in the 1980s, its development was intended for long range snipers in the military or law enforcement who needed strong terminal ballistics and could penetrate various types and layers of body armor, such as ceramic plates and ballistic mesh weaves, even at extremely long distances. I have attended matches where a $5500 rifle in 338L has been no more than competitive with 6.5mm rifles costing 1/3 as much. The higher the BC, the better the bullet is at resisting drag and wind drift. With 250 grain bullets, the Win Mag is pushing 2650, while the Lapua is just short of 3000 fps. We are completely aware that this is not by any means a comprehensive list given the amount of options available, but the sake of brevity, we have to limit our selections. But, if you’re a hardcore long-range shooter or big game hunter, a 338 Lapua rifle will show people just how dedicated you are.  Designed in the 1980s, its development was â¦ So, the financial barrier to entry for shooting 338 Lapua is pretty high. Having lived through several natural disasters and more than a few man-made ones (hello 2008), he believes that resilience and self-sufficiency are essential in this increasingly unpredictable world.

As you can imagine, that makes the ballistics an important component of this article. We will first look at the short range trajectories of the ten selected rounds. The .308 Win has been and still is one of the most effective short action cartridges for medium to larger game in North America. We also cannot discount the recoil. For that, we have to dive into hand loading rounds, and that is better served in a separate article. For most people, the cost just isn’t practical. In our ballistics section, we will take a look at several categories including the velocity, ballistic coefficient, and the trajectories of the ten rounds we have selected for comparison. Energy transfer is not always 100% and how much is transferred also depends on the expansion of the bullet. To compare these two cartridges, we have selected five rounds for each of the cartridges, which we have listed below. Huston is a hunting enthusiast who believes your success in the field is directly correlated to the amount of preparation at home. As a result of this, it became more widely available. With a degree in Microbiology and several years of doctoral work manipulating bacterial genes, he attempts to merge the rational and unbiased thinking of scientific research with the passions of hunting and fishing. Which leaves just one question: Jay Chambers is a pro-free speech business owner based in Austin, Texas. Dec 21, 2010 #1 A. anaconda33 Member. For a lot of hunters and marksmen, recoil is often not one of the major concerns or points for deciding on cartridges. It was developed during the 1980s as a high-powered, long-range cartridge for military snipers. If we were to average the rounds for each cartridge, the .338 LM rounds have right around a half inch less bullet drop at this range, though there are .308 rounds that have as flat or flatter trajectories than some of the heavier .338 LM rounds (280 and 300gr). Penetration is the second category that we will look at as it pertains to stopping power. There are hunting situations that require a round that carries a lot of energy over long-range. Best 9mm Ammo 2019 [Self-Defense & Target], 6.5 Creedmoor vs .243 Win – Cartridge Comparison, Best .40 S&W Ammo: Self Defense & Target Practice. We don’t discount the information that comes from a well known professional, but even then they can have good and bad days. The kinetic energy of this cartridge is nearly 3,000ft.lb at 500 yards with even larger numbers within that range which is enough to take on the really big and dangerous game. Even with the increased rifle weight, we used with the .338 Lapua Magnum rounds we still see a definitive increase in recoil energy when compared to the .308 Win rounds. The 338 LM will eventually beat the hell out of you after 50 rounds, even in a â¦ And, a less wind-affected round means that it’s easier to make accurate wind calls. So, what does this mean for those of us who aren’t spec ops snipers or professional long-range competitors? The 338 Lapua, while it is undoubtedly effective enough, is an over-rated cartridge which has been successfully sold to various governments. We saw that the .338 LM rounds had higher BCs and flatter trajectories, especially past 500 yards. The flat trajectory is one of the reasons that long-range shooters really like the 338 Lapua. You also get a round with velocities that remain supersonic out past 1,000 yards. I also slipped on a suppressor which really helped the noise and the recoil. As we wrap up this cartridge comparison between the .338 Lapua Magnum vs .308 Winchester, we want to take just a little bit of space to pick a few individual rounds from each cartridge that we think pairs well with specific applications. With such higher BCs, it will be interesting to see how the selected rounds stack up in other performance categories. Thread starter anaconda33; Start date Dec 21, 2010; Help Support Long Range Hunting : Join the LRH Team or . 338 Norma. For long range precision shooting, perhaps the dilemma might arise for some. Or for max performance go to a FL 2.90", blown out Rigby case and gain another ~20gr H2O capacity. In the simplest of terms, a ballistic coefficient is simply a number that is derived from several variables taken from the cartridge specs including the bullet. FN Ballista Bolt-Action Rifle 26" Barrel 338 Lapua 5rd - FDE Finish - Dual-Caliber Rifle Package - 3703041002 Out of stock View Details » View Details » Out of stock But, that makes sense. Thatâs splitting hairs for on-game performance, but makes a pretty big difference for long range shooting. The .338 Lapua Magnum (LM) was introduced to the market in the late 1980’s and was designed for a specific purpose; to provide snipers with a cartridge that could punch through barriers and body armor from an incredible distance. At this point, the .338LM rounds sustain their velocities at a higher rate than the .308 rounds.

These are also factory loads, so you are going to be looking at factory load performances. However, that long-range power is useful for one type of shooting that ordinary humans do: long-range big game hunting. Both of these cartridges have the capacity to become excellent long range cartridges and the range you are looking at dictates which might be better. The.338 Lapua rifle became something of an intermediary between the long-standing.308 Winchester and.50 BMG cartridges in widespread western service, but has now branched out worldwide to the militaries of over 30 countries. The loaded cartridge is 14.93 mm in diameter and 93.5 mm long. The reason it is so important is that it has a lot of influence on just about every other performance category. Well, one can always fall  back on the venerable .375 H&H Magnum. So, when looking at these numbers, keep in mind what applications you have in mind.
