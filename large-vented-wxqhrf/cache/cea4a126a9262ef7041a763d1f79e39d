Newquay Cornwall Airport is a 5-minute drive away. We came on the Tastes of the Bay deal so ate at the hotel restaurant and fifteen in the evenings- Both were delicious and I'm pleased to say the hotel food was just as good as in the Jamie Oliver restaurant. Stay for New Year. December availability. Excellent value, great food and very friendly staff at the hotel.........not so impressed by the service at Fifteen.
