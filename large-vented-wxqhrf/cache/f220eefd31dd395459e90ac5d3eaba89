Gun Wiki is a FANDOM Lifestyle Community. 	United States of America You extrapolate that since the P-39 proved ineffective against the Zero, it must be the autocannon's fault. 		Country of origin In the American Lexicon, Fighters and persuit planes were designed to destroy enemy fighters. Vsolferi (talk) 18:58, 10 August 2010 (UTC), It is not at all clear what mistaken beliefs you think the first two paragraphs are based on. While 37mm is not that powerful when compared to the 76mm, 88mm, and other big guns carried by WWII tanks; a 37mm could knock out a tank if it hit them in a vunerable area, i.e.  It was also equipped with four .30 caliber, and two .50 caliber machine guns, which were no doubt for use against smaller, faster, maneuvering aircraft. It was thought that a cannon was needed to have the fire power to down a large heavy bomber. I don't feel that this discussion will go anywhere as it's gone full-circle. It was magazine-fed and could be fired either manually or by remote control using a solenoid mounted on the rear of the weapon. â¢ The 37 mm M9 autocannon was a derivative of the M1A2 anti-aircraft gun. 		Type A safety feature incorporated in the design of the trigger mechanism prevented firing a round until the breechblock assembly was put into battery position. The first early half tracks had been pioneered by Adolphe Kégresse in 1910, when at the service of the Tsar Imperial Garage.  	 It entered military service in 1942, used in the Bell P-39 Airacobra and P-63 Kingcobra aircraft. 	   In Dog fighting scenarios where a P-39 would be employing aggressive air combat maneuvers against a A6M Zero or Bf-109 it was certainly true that the fire rate and trajectory of the 37mm M4 would have made it an ineffective weapon. The 37 mm M9 autocannon was a derivative of the M1A2 anti-aircraft gun. I'm going to move it to the M4 page and suggest you find some strong references to back up your strong assertions on the effectiveness of the M4. The 37 mm Automatic Gun, M4, known as the T9 during development, was a 37 mm (1.46 in) recoil operated autocannon designed by Browning Arms Company. 	Usage According to Birch Matthews book on the development of the P-39 and P-63 [Cobra! The P-39 (or P-400) only used the Hispano briefly and I believe only in its drum-fed M1 form with a 60 round magazine capacity. The threat of large numbers of heavy bomber formations, that the cannon was employed on Airacobras to combat, was something that the allies never really had to face in the war. 	Colt M15 half-track. 	 I added some amplifying information about usage of the 37mm cannon on board PT Boats and JFK using an M3 AT gun on his boat. It had a 74-inch barrel, weighed 405 pounds (the barrel alone weighing 120 pounds), had a muzzle velocity of 3,000 feet per second, and had a rate of fire of 150 rounds per minute.  The 37 mm Automatic Gun, M4 (known as the T9 during development) was a 37mm recoil-operated autocannon designed by the Browning Arms Company and manufactured by Colt. But again formations of 'Bettys' or Ju-88s, or Me-110s, on straight bombing runs the M4 would have been performing the role it was designed for. Because pilots weren't used to the weapon's drooping arc of fire, the quadruple M4s were replaced by a single 75mm M5 cannon with two .50 caliber heavy machine guns. --136.2.1.104 (talk) 16:14, 20 December 2010 (UTC) . I obtained this info from interviewing 12 different PT boat veterans from WW2 and restoring PT658 in Portland, OR Jerry (jngilmar)  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 134.134.139.71 (talk) 17:42, 16 November 2008 (UTC), There is a paragraph here that does not belong: "John F. Kennedy's PT-109 had a US Army M3 37mm Anti-tank Gun installed on the foredeck by removing its wheels and bolting it to a heavy timber (4 in x 4 in) which was attached to the deck. 	  37mm Cannon. Why he chose that cannon and, how well it worked was the topic of the discussion. 	 History: P-38L s/n 44-53186 was manufactured by Lockheed at their Burbank, California facility in 1945. â¢ The 37 mm M9 autocannon was a derivative of the 37 mm M1A2  flak gun and used the longer, more powerful 37×223mmSR cartridge. They were integral to the strategic thinking of the time, and so the Air Corps worked under the assumption that similar weapons were being developed by other nations, and conceived the need for a new "interceptor" to climb fast and high to intercept incoming bombers. The fledgeling Bell aircraft company was trying to hedge it's bets and cover the fighter/persuit/interceptor roles with a single aircraft. An anti-aircraft weapon, the M4 had a muzzle velocity of 2,000 feet per second and a cyclic rate of 150 rounds per minute. Ammunition. (25 kg) With breech: â¦ Army appropriation bill, 1921, by Committee on Military Affairs, Subcommittee No. The White Motor Company produced a prototype halftrack using their own chassis and the body of the M3 Scout Car. The objective is a (possibly operational) 1/20th scale 37mm Canon. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 136.2.1.104 (talk) 19:25, 13 October 2010 (UTC), --Vsolferi (talk) 19:27, 13 October 2010 (UTC), (note: Moved from my talk page. The radios in Airacobras allowed coordination of the aircraft by both ground stations, and flight leaders in the air.  1, United States, Senate. I think one can conclude that large caliber auto-cannons like the M4 were effective against large, non-maneuvering planes like bombers, but were not well suited for air to air combat involving agressively maneuvering targets such as other fighter aircraft. Also, it did not feature the rear access doors, and is outwardly very similar to the M5, but with a different internal configuration. It was accepted as the 37 mm Automatic Gun, M4, intended for a anti-aircraft weapon for intercepting and shooting down large aircraft. Loza explains that there has been a mis-interpretation of the term "ground support" from the Russian definition [which means stopping enemy aircraft from attacking Russian Ground troups] to the allied definition of "ground Attack" [Where Russian aircraft would attack troops on the ground]. They are equipped with a 37 mm M4 Automatic Gunâ a huge 213-pound autocannon designed by John Browing and taken from P-39 Airacobra and P-63 Kingcobra fighters, as well as at least two 20mm Oerlikon forward, likely a 40mm Bofors single aft, and two twin M2 .50 cal tubs. as well as for much of the article's life prior to that date, but were removed in the update made here: 08:55, 1 December 2015‎ BilCat, This includes the claims of the 30 round endless loop belt actually being 33 rounds in capacity, arranged in 3 groups of 10 HE or AP ammunition with a tracer round at the end of each. --Vsolferi (talk) 15:39, 22 July 2011 (UTC)-vsolferi  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 136.1.1.105 (talk) 15:36, 22 July 2011 (UTC), The jamming issue is one that is tough to quantify, but it was a factor in the gun's reputation, true.  This is of particular relevance to multiple claims present here: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=M4_cannon&oldid=693185660   I'm removing it and moving it to the M3 article.--Nukes4Tots (talk) 00:43, 24 February 2009 (UTC), Okay, not entirely sure why, but the history of this autocannon is missing. M4 cannon --Nukes4Tots (talk) 16:35, 1 June 2009 (UTC) ), You can't reasonably compare machine guns with autocannons in a side-by-side review... the two will NOT compare favorably, regardless of what standard of comparison you are using. 	 --136.1.1.104 (talk) 19:05, 5 August 2011 (UTC). Am I missing something or is there any reason not to add this? It was used in the Bell P-39 Airacobra and P-63 Kingcobra. 	Recoil-operated The US Army bought several Citröen-Kégresse vehicles for evaluation in the late twenties, and developed their own sâ¦  Sold Surplus in 1946 for $1,250 it was used for aerial mapping until 1967 when it went on display at Harrah Automobile Collection where it remained on display unitl 1982. 		Used by So of course there is eventually a specification that requires the cannon to be n the plane, but it's because Bell sold the army on the 37mm cannon in an interceptor , not because the army originally wrote a specification for an interceptor with a 37mm cannon in it. The M4 was later replaced by the more powerful 37mm M9 autocannon. 	 (and while I'm not sure this loading was used exclusively, it at least appears to point to there being a genuine 33 round capacity; I'd expect come loadings included 33 rounds of HE/T ammunition as that shell appears to be the most commonly used on aircraft mounted examples the weapon in general and made every single round useful as a tracer, which really makes sense given the slow rate of fire and genuine need to track the trajectory of individual shots), That article also cites the quotation made by Chuck Yeager where the weapon's trajectory was likened to "throwing a grapefruit". The design, using as many commercial components as possible to improve reliability and rate of production, was standardized in 1940 and builâ¦ 		Production began  	 The bell aircraft Corperation 1934-1946], the original concept of the development of an "interceptor" by the US army air corps in the 1930s was to combat the threat of large long range bombers. The M4 was later replaced by the more powerful 37mm M9 autocannon. 37 mm Automatic Gun, M4, Bell P-39 Airacobra, at National Museum of the United States Air Force (formerly the United States Air Force Museum).   M4s were mounted on numerous U.S. Navy PT boats as deck guns, starting with the Solomon Islands campaign.  It is normally loaded with M54 high-explosive tracer shells, but the weapon is also usable with M80 armor-piercing shells that could penetrate through an inch of armor plate at a distance of 500 yards.  Especially Japanese guns are very poorlydocumented, and as there were a great number of different guns inservice in the Japanese Army and Navy, the potential forconfusion is enormous. Conversely, the allies deployed such bombers by the tens of thousands against the Germans, and the response by the Germans was to fit large caliber cannons [30mm mk108] similar to the M4 to the later variants of the bF-109, and FW-190, while making four of them the exclusive weapons on the me-262. Please check your local laws before ordering.  	 Although there was some consideration had been given to replacing the machine guns with more a powerful anti-tank gun, the situation only began to change after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. In this role a plane is best armed with multiple weapons of high fire rate to give the pilot a greater statistical chance of scoring hits on a small, fast, maneuvering aircraft. 	150 rpm  165 rpm (M10 cannon) 	 The cannon was disliked by pilots for its drooping trajectory. Russian air to air tactics were very poor at the outset of the war. The model. Later in the war the more powerful 37 mm M9 was developed. You are incorrect in stating that Wildcats could "cut Zeros out of the sky". M9A1 â Same as M9, with ring mount and three MG pintles.  However, smaller autocannons were very often used in dogfighting, notably by the Japanese Mitsubishi Zero which had two 20mm cannon, one per wing, and two or four MGs. In fact, the 4x4 timber was used as a float by Kennedy and crew to keep them together during their swim ashore from the stricken hull, since they had displaced their life raft to make room for the 37mm cannon." Wikipedia. Citröen also used these skills when Kégresse returned in France to design a series of civilian vehicles that made a famous worldwide trip, the âParis-Pékinâ, also known as the âYellow Cruiseâ.  Primary targets were landing barges used by enemy forces to move supplies down the island chain at night. My previous posts explain what I believe drove Bell to that choice: Big gun for attacking Big planes, small guns for attacking small planes. In fact Armor peircing ammunition was part of the plane's weapon load-out options [Except for Russian Airacobras]. The 12/80 was a 12 cm bore in a barrel that was originally designed to be bored to 15,5 cm, so a 12 cm heavy barrel. 	John Browning The lock frame was retracted by recoil action during automatic firing, and is forced forward by the driving springs. After evaluation of the aircraft prototype, The Army liked the idea of the Cannon and so the specifications of the contract included the 37mm Cannon. Shortly thereafter it was purchased by its current ownâ¦  The driving spring assemblies held the lock frame against the carrier dog until the carrier was released by carrier catch, which was pivoted by an incoming round. Due to the unprecedented amount of orders, the procurement on all the components and the manufacturing time necessary to â¦ 102-103. The "M9" was a related half-track armored car design. In 1989 it was flown from California to the United Kingdom in an epic transatlantic crossing. Browning and the Colt Firearms Co reworked it into the T9/M4.  		Rate of fire P-39 and the later P-63 were used exclusively in the air superiority role as air-to-air fighters. The 15 rounds were in three five-round clips, an unsatisfactory arrangement according to Kelsey, and the M9 did not perform reliably in flight.   The non-recoiling parts included the trunnion block group, the feed box and feeding mechanism, the recuperator cylinder and bushing, the back plate group, and the manual charger assembly. Soviet pilots, though off-put by the M4's slow cyclic rate and the low magazine capacity, had appreciated its reliability.  Little is known about this gun's deployment; the only confirmed use is in the US Navy PT boats mentioned above. The Russians pilots would dive to very high speed on German formations, and make a single pass and egress [boom and Zoom]. Most encounters were typically of the ambush type, where firing the weapons was held until very close range. It is worth noting that description of Russian encounters with German aircraft follow the paradigm of the use for the M4 as a weapon for use against non-maneuvering targets. M4 27mm auto cannon on P-63 Kingcobra.com, https://guns.fandom.com/wiki/M4_cannon?oldid=83636. In the mid-1930s, the United States Army had yet to field a dedicated anti-tank artillery piece; anti-tank companies of infantry regiments were armed with .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns. The poor dogfighting quality of the 37mm M4 autocannon as described in the Birch Matthews book is true. 4. This cannon was installed only days before the mission where PT-109 was lost. Weapons similar to or like 37 mm Gun M1. Most PT boat gunners used tracer rounds to sight the fall of their shots. 		Caliber The experimental XP-58 Chain Lightning, a larger, more heavily armed version of the P-38 Lightning, was originally equipped with four M4s in its nose. The function of the breechblock was to help in the final chambering of the round, close the breech, and actuate the trigger trip. Top of the bullet ( fuse ) has â G15216 and picture of the anchor. One of the most fearsome was the "Quad-50" anti-aircraft platform which saw a battery of 4 x 0.50 (12.7mm) caliber Browning heavy machine guns mounted atop a turning pedestal. 	 The Russian pilots appreciated the Cobra's 'devastating' firepower which enabled them to destroy the target bandit in a single pass.  	1939 It had a 74-inch barrel, weighed 405 pounds (the barrel alone weighing 120 pounds), had a muzzle velocity of 3,000 feet per second, and had a rate of fire of 150 rounds per minute. Designation: 37 mm/56 M4: Ship Class Used On: PT Boats: Date Of Design: about 1937: Date In Service : 1942 (on PT Boats) Gun Weight: Without breech: 55 lbs. The army didn't issue a pre-specification for someone to design a fighter with a 37mm cannon in it. — Preceding unsigned comment added by Kool kitty89 (talk • contribs) 23:47, 7 June 2016 (UTC), Why is there no mention of the weapon's use in the YFM-1 Airacuda? Extraction, ejection, feeding and loading were done during counter-recoil. The 37 mm M9 autocannon was a derivative of the M1A2 anti-aircraft gun. Primarily used for air-to-air combat on the Eastern Front, the M4 was sometimes used against soft ground targets. Take your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat. The M6 boasted an oval-shaped framework (nicknamed a "horsecollar magazine" for its shape) providing a track for the endless belt. 	 The trajectory was a mismatch for the high velocity weapons it was mated with on the P-39, but this is also true of the MG FF and MK 108 combined with cannons and/or machine guns of higher velocity as was common in German service, as well as various combinations of cannons used by the Japanese. It had a 74-inch barrel, weighed 405 pounds (the barrel alone weighing 120 pounds), had a muzzle velocity of 3,000 feet per second, and had a rate of fire of 150 rounds per minute. The M1A2 followed and the Navy and Army Air Force adopted it for shipboard use and aircraft use respectively as the M4 cannon.  By absorbing the energy of the lock frame, the back plate assembly reduced the shock against the carrier pin as the lock frame was hatched to the rear. there is however no evidence it was ever used as an effective tank buster. 	 It also provided a mounting for the firing pin. Anti-aircraft autocannon developed in the United States. M4s were initially mounted on a simple pedestal mount (often built at the front lines) with the standard M6 magazine being used. With the goal of finding a high-mobility infantry vehicle, the Ordnance Department had evaluated the half-track design by testing French Citroën-Kégresse vehicles.  The 37 mm autocannon had its root in 1921, designed by famed American firearms designer John M. Browning. Beginning in 1944, the M9 cannon was installed at the builders' boatyard as standard equipment. It was used on PT boats around 1944 in the Pacific theater during World War II, replacing the M4 autocannon. The springs then drove the lock frame assembly forward to operate the ejector, chamber the round, and raise the breech block. The cannon is misunderstood and often misrepresented. 	 The disscussion of the cannons of other calibers is a bit of a tangent, but I'll comment on it: The effectiveness of those weapons is not in question, as they were very effective in the air-to-air role, but they do not offer insight or provide evidence for the effectiveness of the 37mm in Air-to-air combat. From such close distances, rate of fire, and trajectory were not a problem. ... T28E1 CGMC â M3 based Combination Gun Motor Carriage equipped with one M1A2 37 mm autocannon (240 rounds) flanked by 2 M2WC machine guns (3,400 rounds). Initial loading and cocking of the weapon was done manually. The M4 proved to be particularly unpopular with U.S. Air Force pilots, due to the weapon's drooping trajectory.  --Nukes4Tots (talk) 16:33, 1 June 2009 (UTC). Between the world wars, the US Army sought to improve the tactical mobility of its forces. The only standard aircraft in service at the time to use the M4 was the Bell P-39 Airacobra and the P-63 Kingcobra. When they proved successful as anti-barge weapons, they were used in this role for the rest of the war. 	213 lb (97 kg) Thisshould be an obvious fact, but alas there is a lot ofmisinformation around.
