The calculator will show you the work and detailed explanation. Hence, the zeros of the quadratic polynomial f (x) are 1/√2 and -1/√2. This is only equal to zero when x is equal to zero. If one of the zeroes of a quadratic polynomial of the form x² + ax + b is the negative of the other, then it (a) has no linear term and the constant term is negative. 19. Factoring by inspection is normally the first solution strategy studied by most students. Example 1: Find the zeros of the quadratic polynomial 6x 2 – 13x + 6 and verify the relation between the zeros and its coefficients. 1. 	3x2 – kx + 6  The zeroes of the quadratic polynomial 3x² – 48 are (a) both negative (b) one positive and one negative (c) both positive (d) both equal. Then, to find the root we have to have an x for which x^2 = -3. It is positive if the polynomial has two real roots, and it is negative if roots are complex. The numerals a, b, and c are coefficients of the equation, and they represent known numbers. For example- f(x)=x-12 ,g(x)=12x,h(x)=-7x+8 are linear polynomials. asked Sep 27 in Polynomials by Anika01 (48.6k points) polynomials; class-10; 0 votes. asked Feb 9, 2018 in Class X Maths by aditya23 (-2,145 points) polynomials.
