[159], Field concerned with the safety, health and welfare of people at work, National legislation and public organizations, Differences between countries and regions, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence, It can be confusing that British English also uses, Fanning, Fred E. (2003). The European Agency for Safety and Health at Work states indicates that nations having less developed OSH systems spend a higher fraction of their gross national product on job-related injuries and illness[141] – taking resources away from more productive activities. There are multiple levels of training applicable to the field of occupational safety and health (OSH). PROFESSIONAL ACCREDITATION Hazard based programs also have the advantage of not assigning or implying there are "acceptable risks" in the workplace. [71] In the UK the disparity was even greater with males comprising 97.4% of workplace deaths. [3] OSH also protects all the general public who may be affected by the occupational environment.[4]. Occurring annually since 2003,[158] each year it focuses on a specific area and bases a campaign around the theme. The American Society for Safety Engineers (ASSE), American Board of Industrial Hygiene (ABIH), and American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) offer individual certificates on many different subjects from forklift operation to waste disposal and are the chief facilitators of continuing education in the OSH sector. An occupational health and safety specialist works to prevent or decrease any type of injury or harm to people in the workplace. [47], The mining industry still has one of the highest rates of fatalities of any industry. [citation needed], The calculation of risk is based on the likelihood or probability of the harm being realized and the severity of the consequences. However, in the context of OSH, “harm” generally describes the direct or indirect degradation, temporary or permanent, of the physical, mental, or social well-being of workers. "[6] Health has been defined as "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. As mentioned previously, examples of these sources include interviews with people who have worked in the field of the hazard, history and analysis of past incidents, and official reports of work and the hazards encountered.
