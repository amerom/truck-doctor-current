Dynamic drivers are usually activated by a voice coil that’s attached near the center of a diaphragm - most often a paper, plastic or metal cone. Planar headphones lie somewhere between dynamic driver headphones (e.g., Sennheiser HD800) and Electrostatic headphones (e.g., Kingsound KS-H1, Stax, etc. These drivers are available in standard sizes from just a few manufacturers and can be selected and rebranded based on the needs of the individual headphone company. Audeze makes the best planar magnetic headphones in the world, with multiple patents and technological breakthroughs which no one else can claim.  Audeze’s large planar drivers produce a planar wavefront that results in imaging that puts you right. This means that there is no change in resistance regardless of the frequency, offering a huge boost in control and resolution compared to a dynamic driver. Dynamic: Dynamic drivers have the most simple configuration out of all the driver types. Why do breakups occur and what are they? Ceny w 3 sklepach. Strategies for optimizing planar design are presented, and illustrated However, dynamic cone drivers have serious inherent design limitations which means that what you’re saving in money, you’re losing in audio quality. Planar Magnetic Technology - you may have heard of it. C $920.86. The result is akin to striking gold: the same treasure as seen in the reunion of brothers Deimos and Phobos from mythology.
