Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle. With such powerful and obvious motives to union, affecting all parts of our country, while experience shall not have demonstrated its impracticability, there will always be reason to distrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to weaken its bands. Whatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend. In his Farewell Address, President George Washington warned of a number of things. A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. See images of the original document of Washington's Farewell Address above, and the full text below. The first president believed that taking sides among other nations could prove risky for the United States and that aligning too much with or against other nations diverted his nation's interests from important matters at home. The Claypooleâs American Daily Advertiser in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was the first newspaper to publish George Washingtonâs âFarewell Addressâ on September 19, 1796. That is, “the benign influence of good laws under a free government.”8. The experiment, at least, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. This government, the offspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full investigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its principles, in the distribution of its powers, uniting security with energy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, has a just claim to your confidence and your support. His thought, in what became known as the Farewell Address in 1796, is clear: "the spirit of party" serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. As he stepped down from the presidency, Washington urged Americans to always place the interests of the nation over their political and regional affiliations. All Rights Reserved. But, if I may even flatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, some occasional good; that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign intrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism; this hope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare, by which they have been dictated. To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the whole is indispensable. Having taken it, I determined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it, with moderation, perseverance, and firmness. Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight), the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it. The Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, advocated strong central government. Hence, likewise, they will avoid the necessity of those overgrown military establishments which, under any form of government, are inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as particularly hostile to republican liberty. Plagued by painful dentures and rheumatism, and facing increasing attacks from opponents of his policies, the former Revolutionary War general decided he would not seek a third term in the nation’s highest office. Sympathy for the favorite nation, facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification. His â Farewell Address,â first drafted by Madison and later amended and â¦ With me a predominant motive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and mature its yet recent institutions, and to progress without interruption to that degree of strength and consistency which is necessary to give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own fortunes. In early 1796, President George Washington decided not to seek reelection for There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your indulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar occasion. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passions. Senator Tim Kaine discusses the reading of Washington's Farewell Address in Congress, Shira Lurie, Ph.D.University College Fellow in Early American HistoryDepartments of History and Canadian Studies, University of Toronto. It is an illusion, which experience must cure, which a just pride ought to discard. Spell. 3200 Mount Vernon Memorial HighwayMount Vernon, Virginia 22121. George Washington's Farewell address, delivered on September 19, 1796, remains a a towering statement of American political purpose.

In the spring of 1796, Washington found Madison’s draft, made some additions of his own, and turned it over to Hamilton, who ended up drafting his own version. Not unconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications, experience in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, has strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself; and every day the increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that the shade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. The strength of my inclination to do this, previous to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an address to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and the unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me to abandon the idea. This within certain limits is probably true; and in governments of a monarchical cast, patriotism may look with indulgence, if not with favor, upon the spirit of party. The nation, prompted by ill-will and resentment, sometimes impels to war the government, contrary to the best calculations of policy. It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. Flashcards. HISTORY reviews and updates its content regularly to ensure it is complete and accurate. While, then, every part of our country thus feels an immediate and particular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to find in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater resource, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less frequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is of inestimable value, they must derive from union an exemption from those broils and wars between themselves, which so frequently afflict neighboring countries not tied together by the same governments, which their own rival ships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which opposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate and embitter. I will only observe that, according to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from being denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually admitted by all. Hence, frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. Washington explained that partisanship “open[ed] the door to foreign influence and corruption” because it weakened voters’ abilities to make reasoned and disinterested choices. 105; 136. It is, indeed, little else than a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the enterprises of faction, to confine each member of the society within the limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within particular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts. Originally published in David C. Claypoole's American Daily Advertiser on September 19, 1796, Washington devoted much of the address to domestic issues of the time, warning against the rise of political parties and sectionalism as a threat to national unity. Washington feared that partisanship would lead to a “spirit of revenge” in which party men would not govern for the good of the people, but only to obtain and maintain their grip on power. Citizens, by birth or choice, of a common country, that country has a right to concentrate your affections.

Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But a solicitude for your welfare, which cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger, natural to that solicitude, urge me, on an occasion like the present, to offer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent review, some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no inconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all-important to the permanency of your felicity as a people. 6. I shall also carry with me the hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence; and that, after forty five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest. Will it not be their wisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the Union by which they were procured ? In fact, political parties had already begun to emerge by the time Washington stepped aside. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the exercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into different depositaries, and constituting each the guardian of the public weal against invasions by the others, has been evinced by experiments ancient and modern; some of them in our country and under our own eyes. Who that is a sincere friend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation of the fabric? A just estimate of that love of power, and proneness to abuse it, which predominates in the human heart, is sufficient to satisfy us of the truth of this position.

Created by. the period is not far off when we may defy material injury from external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously respected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us provocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our interest, guided by justice, shall counsel. Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your hearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm the attachment. Washington revealed that he had hoped to retire prior to the previous election, but refrained due to the “critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations,” referring to the escalation of tensions with Great Britain over its war with France. Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace and harmony with all. In all the changes to which you may be invited, remember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true character of governments as of other human institutions; that experience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of the existing constitution of a country; that facility in changes, upon the credit of mere hypothesis and opinion, exposes to perpetual change, from the endless variety of hypothesis and opinion; and remember, especially, that for the efficient management of your common interests, in a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is consistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable. While we currently view partisanship as inseparable from the American political process, in the early republic, most condemned parties as divisive, disruptive, and the tools of demagogues seeking power.5 “Factionalism,” as contemporaries called it, encouraged the electorate to vote based on party loyalty rather than the common good. The letter included three main principles: After opening with an explanation of his choice not to seek a third term, Washington’s farewell address urged Americans not to put their regional and sectional interests above the interests of the nation as a whole.

It is well worth a fair and full experiment. The nation which indulges towards another a habitual hatred or a habitual fondness is in some degree a slave. One method of assault may be to effect, in the forms of the Constitution, alterations which will impair the energy of the system, and thus to undermine what cannot be directly overthrown. Four years before Washington actually left office, when he had considered retiring after his first term, he had asked James Madison to draft a farewell address. Courtesy of the Milstein Division of United States History, Local History & Genealogy, The New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations. In the 7,641-word document, the nation’s first president called for the American people to remain unified, resist the rise of political factions and avoid the influence of foreign powers.

The government sometimes participates in the national propensity, and adopts through passion what reason would reject; at other times it makes the animosity of the nation subservient to projects of hostility instigated by pride, ambition, and other sinister and pernicious motives. In 1796, as his second term in office drew to a close, President George Washington chose not to seek re-election. He reminded them that the “independence and liberty” the nation currently enjoyed was the result of the “common dangers, sufferings, and successes” they had experienced together in the American Revolution and early years of the republic. Retaining only the first few paragraphs of Madison’s version, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton conducted an extensive rewrite, with Washington providing the final edits. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall carry it with me to my grave, as a strong incitement to unceasing vows that heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; that your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free Constitution, which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly maintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped with wisdom and virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of these States, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete by so careful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the affection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it. In his farewell Presidential address, George Washington advised American citizens to view themselves as a cohesive unit and avoid political parties and issued a special warning to be wary of attachments and entanglements with other nations. There is some controversy about George Washingtonâs personal religious beliefs. The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in, the office to which your suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of inclination to the opinion of duty and to a deference for what appeared to be your desire.
