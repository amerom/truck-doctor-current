No genetic differences were detected between the colony types in the gene sequences of operons gldFG and gldKLMN, genes gldH, sprA, sprC, sprD, sprE, sprF, sprT, porV, porX, and porY, or in the predicted regulative regions upstream from the genes gldH, sprA, sprE, and porV or operons gldFG, gldKLMN, and sprCDBF. All colony types reached the highest ODmax at higher nutrient level (2xN Shieh). Gliding bacteria are phylogenetically diverse and are abundant in many environments. The adhesins required for the gliding are secreted through a gliding motility-associated protein secretion system, known as the type IX secretion system (T9SS). <> Mean colony size in millimeters (± SE) of colonies growing on 0.5x and 2x Shieh agar plates (A). In F. johnsoniae, for example, secDF mutants have been shown to be incapable of gliding motility and chitin utilization and to produce non-spreading colonies (Nelson and McBride, 2006). 12, 207–214. This work has been funded by grants from Academy of Finland for the Centre of Excellence in Biological Interactions 2012–2017 (#252411) and for L-RS (#266879, #304615), the Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation, Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation and the Doctoral Program in Biological and Environmental Science of University of Jyväskylä. (2010). (2013). The epidemiology of bacterial diseases in food-size channel catfish. However, they do have cytoskeletal elements that give them a distinct non-spherical shape. Thiol oxidoreductases are essential for the folding of several proteins, including those related to virulence (Fabianek et al., 2000), but their function in F. columnare has not been studied. Plates were incubated for 2 days at RT, after which the colony morphology was determined. Appl. Significant differences between colony types were observed in the expression of genes gldG, gldH, gldL, and sprE (Table 1 and Figure 4; for pairwise comparisons, see Table 2). doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.18.8631, Hunnicutt, D. W., Kempf, M. J., and McBride, M. J. Int.          application/pdf J. Bacteriol. The absorbance (600 nm) was measured every 5 min for 65 h. The viability was estimated as the maximum absorbance recorded during the cultivation. While qPCR measures the quantity of a present mRNA of a target gene (Wong and Medrano, 2005), bacterial transcripts of secreted proteins may experience post-transcriptional and post-translational processing steps prior to transportation through the cell membranes. J. Bacteriol. 80, 2728–2736.  In addition, transcriptome analysis of different strains and their colony types could provide insight into gene expression under different nutrient conditions and help to build a more comprehensive perspective on factors that are associated with colony spreading and gliding motility. He is interested in the gliding motility of Mycoplasma. Gliding motility in C. perfringens strains has been linked to the production of type four pili (T4P) [].We therefore conducted scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies to investigate if T4P were present in S13 wt but absent in the S13ΔagrB at the time of onward migration on the agar plate. Liquid bacterial cultures of Rz, R, and S grown in 1x Shieh were streaked on 0.5xN, 1x, and 2xN Shieh plates. now show that FrzS, a protein essential for pilus-based gliding motility in Myxococcus xanthus , moves in an oscillatory pattern by disassembling and reassembling clusters at the cell poles as cells reverse their direction of movement. The movements of individual bacteria growing as a part of forming biofilm were recorded between the agar layer and microslide chamber bottom. Nucleic Acids Res. Therefore, it remains to be resolved whether motility itself is essential for F. columnare virulence or whether gliding motility and virulence are related solely via a common secretion route for adhesins and virulence factors. Flagellar motility: This type of motility is caused by flagella, cell surface appendages. They were, thus, used as reference genes to normalize the gene expressions of gliding motility-associated genes. Rev. For the following data prehandling, GenEx version 6.0 (MultiD Analyses) was utilized. Any missing quantification cycle (Cq) value was replaced with the average Cq of its two qPCR replicates. <>/Font<>/ProcSet[/PDF/Text]>>/Type/Page>> Genomic DNA of F. columnare strain B067 colony types Rz, R and S was extracted from bacterial liquid cultures grown overnight in 1x Shieh medium at RT (115 rpm) using a GeneJET Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Thermo Scientific). Understanding the differences between spreading and non-spreading morphotypes may help to disentangle factors related to gliding motility and virulence in F. columnare. Most animals are motile, using means such as walking, slithering, swimming, and flying to propel themselves through the world. RNA quality was verified by running the samples on an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Chip (Agilent Technologies) in an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and determining the RNA integrity number (RIN) for each sample. “The aligned rank transform for nonparametric factorial analyses using only ANOVA procedures,” in Anonymous Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, Vancouver, BE, 143–146. 18, 1049–1056. SUMMARY Gliding motility is observed in a large variety of phylogenetically unrelated bacteria. The mechanisms that control the assembly and activity of gliding motility machinery and T9SS are not known. Gliding Motility is a method of locomotion that allows for movement, without the help of flagella, on a solid surface. 3:RESEARCH0034. GLIDING MOTILITY INMYXOCOCCUS XANTHUS Most of the research on gliding motility has been conducted withM. glyA and gapdh have been qualified as valid and stably expressed in each F. columnare colony type in various nutrient conditions (Penttinen et al., 2016). In that sense, increased production of SprA under low nutrient levels seems reasonable. Fish Pathol. These results may help to understand the connections between nutrient concentration, gliding motility, and virulence of F. columnare. The 20 μl reactions were performed using Phusion Flash High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), with primer concentrations of 0.5 μM and a template amount of 1–10 ng per reaction. Colony type R expressed only occasional movements regardless of the nutrient level, and cellular organization as a spreading biofilm was not observed (Supplementary Videos 5, 6). The functionality of gliding motility and T9SS in different F. columnare morphotypes is not known, although gldL, gldM, gldN, and gldH have been suggested as putative virulence-associated factors in F. columnare (Dumpala et al., 2010; Klesius et al., 2010). Finally, 100 μl of the solution was transferred to a fresh microplate, and absorbance was determined at the wavelength of 595 nm with a Multiskan FC spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). 11 0 obj doi: 10.1186/gb-2002-3-7-research0034, Wagner, B., Wise, D., Khoo, L., and Terhune, J. Motile bacteria either swim, by using flagella, or glide over surfaces by mechanisms that remain a mystery. 193, 599–610. A whole genome-sequencing approach of different colony morphotypes would be efficient for identifying genetic factors that contribute to the changes in colony spreading. Proteome Sci. M-value (Vandesompele et al., 2002), which indicates gene expression stability, was measured for the current dataset for reference genes glyA and gapdh using CFX Manager version 3.0 (Bio-Rad). The supernatant was first filtered through a 0.45 μm Supor® membrane (Pall Corporation) and then concentrated with 10 K Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units (Merck Millipore) at 4°C to final volume of 2–3 ml. Proteolytic activity was observed in each colony variant, seen as the formation of a clear degradation zone peripheral to the bacterial growth, but no differences between the colony types were observed, and the nutrient concentration did not affect the proteolytic activity (Supplementary Figure S1). Little is known about the directional determinants of so-called gliding motility in bacteria. The R colony type was obtained after exposing the original Rz isolate to bacteriophages (Laanto et al., 2012). 8:588. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2017.00588, Toguchi, A., Siano, M., Burkart, M., and Harshey, R.

The bacteria originating from the same liquid culture were spread on agar plates and grown for 2 days after which the colony morphology was imaged under a light microscope (Figure 1). Because eukaryotic cell motility is driven, in part, by processive intracellular motors, studying how bacteria glide over solid surfaces may lead to the identification of similar types of motors.
