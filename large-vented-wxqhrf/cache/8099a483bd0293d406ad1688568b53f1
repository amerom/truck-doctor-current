Trabecular bone score (TBS), a novel tool in the evaluation of osteoporosis is an indirect indicator of bone microarchitecture. 			NIH With HGCs, these changes were associated with a more dramatic bone loss caused by a major loss of trabecular connectivity. The key difference between trabecular and cortical bone is that the trabecular bone is the more porous inner regional layers of the body that produces red blood cells while the cortical bone is the rigid outer regional layers of the bone that stores fat. Even though osteoporosis does not cause symptoms, it is important to treat. J Bone Miner Res. 2019 Oct;31(10):1375-1389. doi: 10.1007/s40520-019-01294-4. The trabecular network, besides thinning, undergoes changes in topology, notably a conversion of trabecular plates to rods, … This term is much preferred over terms such as demineralization or undermineralization, since we really cant tell the exact mineral status of the patients bone from the radiograph alone.        Bone. J Bone Miner Res. Trabecular bone score (TBS) as a new complementary approach for osteoporosis evaluation in clinical practice. So in your skull, for example, there's a layer of trabecular bone in between two layers of the compact dense bone. Because trabecular bone has a much greater surface area, it is more readily affected by osteoporosis than the cortical bone.          Epub 2018 Aug 1.

As … i'm pretty sure, correct me if i'm wrong, that, DXA measures the whole bone (cortical, trabecular, and any bony changes like arthritis and doesn't account for weight density in its analysis ), as a whole lump sum reading without differentiation between the parts of bone. Also, most short bones consist of trabecular tissue; your wrist and ankles contain short bones. Because of this, trabecular bone is more likely to be affected when the break down and regeneration of bone are out of balance in osteoporosis. So trabecular bone exists at the ends of the long bones, it exists in the core of the vertebrae, and it also exists in sort of shell or plate-like bones. In bones with osteoporosis, the remodeling process has gotten out of whack.Those sturdy crisscrossed structures disappear and bones get weak and start to fracture. Muscle mass and adiposity during late childhood and adolescent maturity may be associated with trabecular morphology that ultimately contributes to long-term skeletal health, according to a study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism.. The most common cause by far of osteopenia is osteoporosis.
