According to HRLC lawyers, more than 260 people have also been brought to Australia for urgent medical treatment after suffering harm in offshore detention centres. For the first few years, people were housed in detention centres, called ‘Regional Processing Centres’ by the government. Why is the detention centre in Nauru? The Australian Refugee Council has also argued that the decision from the High Court “clearly shows the Australian Government is responsible for the operation and therefore the care of those within these detention camps.”[30]. [26] However, this move did not deflect criticism from many UN member states, including many in the Asia-Pacific region, over the offshore processing deal with Australia. Nauru Bulletin, Issue 7-2015/125, Republic of Nauru, Government Information Office, 25 June 2015. However Australia has repeatedly tried to distance itself from taking responsibility for the treatment of asylum seekers sent to Nauru.

Five asylum seekers have died on Nauru since 2014. After many years of heated dispute and criticism, the offshore centre was finally abandoned in 2008. In January 2014, the numbers peaked at 1,353 people. The commission wrote in its November 2014 report that while it could not exercise its powers on Nauru it retained “jurisdiction to consider the legality of Commonwealth activities on the island as they affect the 186 children currently held there.” It thus relied on expert evidence in its inquiry about the situation at the Nauru facility. The “Moss Review,” released in February 2015, investigated allegations of sexual abuse and other physical assaults of “transferees,” as well as the conduct and behaviour of staff employed by Transfield Services and Wilson Security.

Conservative government estimates of spending on maintaining the offshore processing centres in Nauru and Manus Island, PNG in 2015-16 was $880 million (or $677,000 per person) for the 1300 currently in the offshore processing centres.
