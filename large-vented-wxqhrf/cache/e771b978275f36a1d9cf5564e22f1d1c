I've taken a few packet caps, 1 at the router showing the failure, and 1 using the desktop hotspot showing a successful connection to wifi calling. Spent 2 hours with Verizon and they tried everything and now say it's a device problem. Ported 2 numbers from Verizon today to the 3GB/mo plan. Yeah!. This ensures others can benefit from our conversation. Naturally, you canât use Wi-Fi calling if your phone is disconnected from the internet. Just so we're on the same page, what make/model of phone do you have? if the verizon signal is weak, the wi-fi will be weak!! My plan includes wifi calling. As a example - I will try to call a contact in my address book. One thing that may have retriggered the problem is that when I was away for home today I tried to make a call while still in airplane mode. Once activate, Wi-Fi is â¦ Even though there is a cell site at 751Mhz with a stronger signal. New sim installed, Shows LTE, everything else appears to be working, but the WiFi Calling. If Wi-Fi Calling is available, you’ll see Wi-Fi after Brother Printer error code 0x803c010b your carrier name in the status bar. Until this week. Does this make sense?"

With W-fi on, the phone tends to default to a tower that is at 2120Mhz. Like many of you, we have very poor mobile service at home. I believe one of them said they would "resync" the phone.
