List of characters Spongy Spongy is a spongewho first appears in and is the protagonist of the episode "Cave Dwelling Sponge." This faster production of red blood cells is possible by the highly vascularized nature of spongy bone that can transfer the adequate amount of glucose, amino acids, lipids, and trace elements, which is necessary to make red blood cells. Structure - Short, flat and irregulary shaped bones and the epiphysis of long bones. Cancellous bone is typically … One of the bones of the internal, middle, and external tarsus. The trabeculae of the spongy bone work to form along with lines of stress, which gives the bone strength and the flexibility in this area. In addition, the spaces in some spongy bones contain red bone marrow, protected by the trabeculae, where hematopoiesis occurs. The ends of a long bone contain spongy bone and an epiphyseal line. Osteocytes located to close to the blood vessel, which can take on nutrients and expel the waste material with the help of tiny interconnecting channels found on the surface of trabeculae, known as Canaliculi. All of these contribute to the maintenance and repair of bone. A complex thin-walled bone, roughly cuboidal in shape, located in the middle of the skull above the nasal cavities and below the anterior fossa of the cranial cavity.  The alveolar bone between the roots of multirooted teeth. Synonym: Ossification of the distal end of the adductor muscles of the thigh, as may be seen in horseback riders. Spongy Bone: Spongy bones are also called cancellous or trabecular bones. It is lighter, less dense, and more flexible than compact bone. The low density and low weight of spongy bone balance out the heavier and denser compact bone in order to reduce the overall weight of the skeleton. This information should not be considered complete, up to date, and is not intended to be used in place of a visit, consultation, or advice of a legal, medical, or any other professional. By testing it shows that the early human bones were contained a higher percentage of spongy bone compare to modern human bones. Spongy Bone. Cancellated screws are basically self-tapping.

It is recommended to name the SVG file "Illu compact spongy bone.svg" - then the template Vector version available (or Vva) does not need the new image name parameter. The bone that forms the lower, posterior skull; it articulates with the parietal and temporal bones anteriorly, and the atlas inferiorly. Cancellous screws are basically special type of screws which are designed for fixing the cancellous bone. The hip bone or os coxae, composed of the ilium, ischium, and pubis. Such bone is formed without a cartilage model and includes the bones of the face and cranium. Synonym: The most medial wrist (carpal) bone in the distal row. Spongy Bone. Flat bones, like those of the cranium, consist of a layer of diploë (spongy bone), lined on either side by a layer of compact bone . Synonym: A four-pointed bone on each side of the face, uniting the frontal and superior maxillary bones with the zygomatic process of the temporal bone. It occurs when blood vessel crowds together by the trabecular matrix and they condense. The compact bone is denser with having few open spaces, the spongy bone is good for form and stores bone marrow across the lattice-like trabeculae network. Synonym: One of the eight wrist bones, which are aligned in two rows. Blood vessels travel from the harder compact bone toward the spongy bone, by supply the materials which are necessary for the production of blood cells. The human skeleton is composed of about 20% of spongy bone. Stress on trabecular bone causes it to create new and stronger networks, making it extremely adaptable. 1 By contrast, spongy bone tissue (Fig. Its flat upper surface is the cribriform plate, which forms much of the roof of the nasal cavities; its upper surface has a midline bony keel that projects up into the cranial cavity and on both sides of which are perforated valleys through which the olfactory nerves project up from the olfactory epithelium.

Bone in which the spicules form a latticework, with interstices filled with embryonic connective tissue or bone marrow. The result of researches shows that in modern humans the lower trabecular bones density is a recent event and caused by increasing sedentary lifestyles.

I would start with an description of the bones spongy bones, compact bones, and the bone cells, especially the bone-building cells, the osteoblasts and the bone-sculpturing cells the osteoclasts and their parents the osteogenic cells. Compact Bone: Compact bones are made up of osteons. The distal row contains (from thumb to little finger) the trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, and hamate bones. The spongy bone is a much porous kind of bone which is found in the animals. The outer surface of a bone is compact bone, and the inner more porous portion is cancellous (spongy) bone. The hyoid bone is suspended by many muscles (the hyoid muscles): the suprahyoid muscles (geniohyoid, mylohyoid, digastric, and hyoglossus) attach the hyoid bone to the mandible and the floor of the mouth; the infrahyoid muscles (omohyoid, sternohyoid, and thyrohyoid) attach it to the larynx and the thoracic cage. It is a separate bone at birth; it begins to fuse with the ischium by age 8, and it is fully fused with the ischium and ilium by 16-18 years of age. compact bone (description) hard, denser and with fewer spaces; forms diaphyses.

This bone is highly vascularized and consists of red bone marrow. Trabecular bone, also known as spongy or cancellous bone, is porous and more like a network that allows nerves, blood vessels, and bone marrow to easily fill trabecular bone. This act makes it easier for the movement of muscle to the limbs. Flat bones, like those of the cranium, consist of a layer of diploë (spongy bone), lined on either side by a layer of compact bone (). A bone on both sides of the skull at its base.
