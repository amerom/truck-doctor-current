In food preparation, the function of amylase is the same as in the body. When the pancreas is damaged, these digestive enzymes can be found in the blood at higher levels than normal. The process of breaking down food and absorbing nutrients is known as digestion. Although it is primarily an exocrine gland, secreting a variety of digestive enzymes, the pancreas has an endocrine function.

The primary function of the small intestine is to facilitate the breakdown and absorption of nutrients needed by the body. As soon as food is eaten, the pancreas releases digestive enzymes into the bowel to break food down. The pancreas contains special cells known as the Islets of Langerhans that detect blood-glucose levels. Usually, the body's own immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria and viruses — mistakenly destroys the insulin-producing (islet, or islets of Langerhans) cells in the pancreas. The digestive role of the liver is to produce bile and export it to the duodenum. Introduction. Function . Sixteen digits are present, four on each toe.
