The State of Texas owns the water, and LCRA manages the water for the people of Texas. Consequently, the landowner is presumed to own underground water until it is conclusively shown that the the source of supply is a subterranean river. The state of the law with respect to ownership of subterranean rivers is not settled in Texas. (Chapter 122 of the Texas Natural Resources Code). He sold the right to drain 65 billion gallons of water a year from underneath his land. Produced Water in Texas: No Dedication Without Compensation. Groundwater belongs to the owners of the land above it and may be used or sold as private property. The majority of states follow the American rule, which affords pore space ownership to the surface estate owner. Over 70% of the earth‘s surface is covered with it, yet only 2.5% of all that water is fresh water suitable for consumption.1 Of that 2.5%, nearly 70% is locked up in glaciers, and about 30% is groundwater.2 Small wonder, then, that range wars were fought over water in the early days of the West. Pt. Who owns the groundwater in Texas? Texas preserves the right of landowners to impound up to 200 acre-feet of water in a stock tank on their property without a permit. It is well established in Texas that groundwater is part of the surface estate, owned by the surface owner as a vested property right. Who Owns the Water?

With only a handful of exceptions discussed below, in order to use this state-owned water, a person must file a permit and obtain a “water right” from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Permits are also not required for emergency use in firefighting, drilling for oil, shrimp and fish farming, or sediment controls in surface coal mining. Whether the surface and mineral estates are severed or unit-ed, the rule in Texas is the same—the mineral estate dominates. This surface water is public property; however, the state confers on individuals and organizations the right to use water from a stream, creek, pond, or lake or to impound water in a lake or pond. Water availability has become such a critical issue that many statewide meetings, legislation and court cases revolve around the subject.

Awarding permits for these "water rights" is a task of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Surface water is publicly owned and governed by the State of Texas. The surface estate exists for the benefit and use of the mineral owner. The first step in analyzing water law issues in Texas is to understand the different categories of water and the legal approaches to each. We’ll argue both the subsurface corpus ownership-based and groundwater-based cases for Texas surface owners’ property rights in formation water. Prior to the runoff reaching a watercourse, it is free to be captured, or diverted and stored, by the landowner for the landowner’s personal use, and in many rural areas this is exactly what takes place … surface estate owns the formation water regardless of whether a court determines it to be groundwater under Texas law.
