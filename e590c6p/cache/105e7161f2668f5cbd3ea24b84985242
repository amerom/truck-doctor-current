AN OVERVIEW TO SOLAR AND IRRIGATION THE SOLAR ALTERNATIVE If traditional pumping technologies, such as manual or animal-powered pumps, reach their technical limits, the customary means of pumping irrigation water are diesel-, gas- or petrol-driven pumps. Irrigation is an effort to provide, regulate and dis­ pose irrigation water for supporting agriculture with the kindsconsisting ofsurface irrigation, swamp irri­ gation, under-groundwater irrlqatlon, pump irriga­ tion and.pond irrigation. irrigation schedules are not presented in this publication but will be the subject of later papers in the series.
