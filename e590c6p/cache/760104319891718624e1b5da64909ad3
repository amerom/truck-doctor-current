Assistive technology helps students with disabilities learn more effectively, in turn helping them be more successful in and out of the classroom. Assistive technology devices used to be big, clunky pieces of equipment that drew attention to learning and physical disabilities. Why is assistive technology important for students with disabilities? Today, assistive devices are often the same types of technology K-12 students are using in traditional classrooms, and there is a âcoolnessâ factor in both instances. What is Assistive Technology? Of course, students with special educational needs have been using assistive technology for quite some time already. They are also an example of assistive technology.
