According to the ILC, the criterion for attribution of conduct either to State forces or the UN is based on 'the factual control' that is exercised over the specific conduct taken by the organ placed at the receiving organisation's disposal. The notion of attribution is primarily used to determine if the State is responsible for the wrongful conduct of persons or entities with links to the State. Throughout that time basic concepts of State responsibility, such as attribution, breach, excuses and consequences were examined and set out in 59 Articles. What blocks automatic attribution of its conduct to the IO in such a case is the operation of the general rule of (automatic) attribution in Article 4 ARSIWA: acts of the organ of a State are attributable to that State. a) A State is 'injured' in case that it has suffered a damage from the internationally wrongful conduct.

The grounds of attribution of conduct as codified by the International Law Commission in the Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts fail to capture different dimensions of the use of force by non-state actors.
