Established in 2017, Jiangsu Gewabin Heat Technology Co., Ltd is a manufacturer and trader specializing in the research,design,development and production of refrigeration with well-equipped facilities and strong technical force. To reduce the condenser temperature, one of the easiest ways is the application of a direct evaporative cooler in front of the condenser used to cool the air down before it passes over the condenser. In simple terms, an evaporative condenser uses a system of tubes exposed to a constant flow of water to cool and condense a hot gas. Chilled water or non-compressorized DX air handling unit, from 6,000 - 60,000 cfm. Evaporative Pre-Cooling of AC Condenser Coil for Improved AC Efficiency Summary: This is an attempt to increase the cooling capacity of a standard household split air conditioning system while reducing energy usage. The bacteria is carried in small water droplets and is commonly found in poorly maintained cooling towers. Baltimore. The cooled liquid is then piped to a chiller or an AHU coil to cool the supply air stream. Filters: Back to products overview. From the experimental results, correlations for the water film heat transfer coefficient, air-water mass transfer coefficient and the air-side pressure drop over a deluged tube bundle are developed. The sensible heat exchange in a cooling system can be significant in colder temperatures but is usually only a small percentage of the overall heat rejection from the cooling water. Evaporation is the principal mechanism for heat rejection. Approximately 1000 Btu is lost from the water for every pound evaporated.
