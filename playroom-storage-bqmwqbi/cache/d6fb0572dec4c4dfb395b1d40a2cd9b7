And before it ended on Feb. 5, the five "sea wolves" had sunk 25 ships. In March alone, 48 ships were attacked by U-boats, and nearly all were sunk. The Atlantic U-boat campaign of World War I (sometimes called the "First Battle of the Atlantic", in reference to the World War II campaign of that name) was the prolonged naval conflict between German submarines and the Allied navies in Atlantic waters—the seas around the British Isles, the North Sea and the coast of France.

One group of three torpedo ships did risk Allied wrath by slipping out to attack at Sword beach, successfully sinking a Norwegian destroyer. German intelligence could make certain the process a convoy of ships shifting at sluggish velocity and a wolfpack (3-8) German subs could take a seat … A new radar detector was developed to complement the now ineffective Metox. During 1942 and 1943, more than 20 U-boats operated in the Gulf of Mexico. The Atlantic Charter is considered one of the first key steps toward the establishment of the United Nations. The casualty rate among the submarine crews was 75%: three of every four sailors who went to sea did not return. 24 October 1918.

During January U-boats sank 35 Allied ships and a British destroyer killing 1219 crew and passengers.  U-boats, using their brand new bases in France, attacked convoys and independently-routed ships almost at will. Sonar decoys such a “BOLD” also entered service which would fool enemy sonar about the presence of an underwater U-boat. German U-boats attacked convoys in groups, like packs of wolves circling flocks of sheep. The Battle of the Atlantic was one of the most important fronts in World War II.
