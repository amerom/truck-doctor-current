If the incubator is not already in operation, start the incubator and allow the temperature and humidity to stabilize a day or two before setting eggs. What about humidity for duck eggs? This is an ideal level for the overall development of the egg in the last days of hatching. During the last three days (the "lock-down" period), the humidity level should be increased to between 70-80%. Temperature Most avian species need to be kept in a temperature range of 98.6 - 100.4°F, with 99.5°F usually being the ideal. In an ice block tray you can fill as many of the individual holders with water as is necessary for the perfect level of humidity. Every time you open the incubator some of the humid air gets out and is replaced by not so humid air. IMPORTANT: International Customers, please read before buyingInternational Purchase Page You can test both by turning the incubator off, putting it inside a new room, letting it rest open and empty for a few hours, and then measuring the temperature and humidity inside the room before closing the incubator and seeing what it says.

To avoid harming the turkeys, get the incubator hot before putting the eggs in. Reduced humidity is always a good option when the high levels start to affect the egg cells. This is only the initial temperature, and you must take a few minutes before measuring the humidity levels in an incubator. Farm Innovators Still Air Incubator Helps hatch chicken, quail, duck, goose and other eggs The Farm Innovators Still Air Incubator easily accommodates up to 4 dozen eggs. 50% humidity at 70°F is different from 50% humidity at 90°F. To maintain the safe levels of humidity, you should check humidity levels with each temperature change. If you have a forced-air incubator, set the temperature at 100 degrees Fahrenheit and see how the temperature stabilizes in the next few minutes. You can check a full list of the best egg incubators here. Of these factors, temperature is the most critical. After the first week the air cell should be about 4%, after the second about 9% and after the third about 13-14% of the total volume of the egg.

Abrupt heating from 55 degrees to 100 degrees can cause moisture condenser on the egg valve that can lead to disease and reduce condoms. In the beginning, the humidity will be more than 60%, but in the perfect situation, the humidity level should be around 55%. In general, it is best to have the normal humidity levels during the entire process of hatching. If the ambient humidity in the air outside the incubator is very dry, then incubation humidity levels will be lower than if the air is very humid (wet). Give it plenty of time to heat up and adjust to the humidity in your area. Embryos require oxygen that comes through the shell, and to get the oxygen from the air in the incubator, the humidity and ventilation must be at the right level. Sorry for all the questions. This way, your humidity levels increase and the eggs get the necessary amounts of moisture. In case that humidity is too high, we have a situation when the water loss is too little.

Let the incubator do its job, then open it and see whether the inside thermometer agrees on the temperature. Also, cold air cannot retain much water vapor, so when cold winter air is warmed the In a still-air incubator, add 2 to 3 degrees. That is why the right measurements and proper air conditioning play a crucial role in every stage of hatching.

Temperature and Humidity Generally, the temperature in your incubator should be maintained between 37 and 39 degrees Celcius. Allow fresh eggs to warm up slowly at room temperature before putting in the incubator. As for correct egg incubator placement, make sure there is no direct sunlight, no heating elements nearby, and no airflows either. It always depends on the embryo growth. If the incubator ends up killing all the eggs, you may need to look for a new egg incubator. Am I doing something wrong? In this manner, you can see how humidity plays an important role in egg development. If you are using any other kind of an incubator besides still air, then follow the instructional manual of the incubator. Try out different levels of humidity during the incubation process. Humidity is controlled in order to prevent unnecessary loss of egg moisture. If your water remains in the incubator, the moisture combined with excess air can cause trouble. When the egg loses some of its moisture an air cell will form inside the egg. It should be pretty much the same, otherwise something is definitely broken. If the air cells are too small you will need to lower the humidity. Humidity and temperature are the two most important factors when it comes to hatching eggs in an incubator. There can be plenty of reasons for the humidity to drop like that. In case you have a still air incubator, the initial temperature should be 102 degrees Fahrenheit. Location. The amount of moisture the egg loses depends on the outside humidity. Therefore, you must maintain the constant supply of fresh oxygen. When you open the ventilation, it is also good to remove the water from an incubator. In the last three days, the humidity level should be about 65 %. The Little Giant incubator kit resembles the one from Hova-Bator. Temperature, humidity, ventilation and turning. This is the stage when you can start putting eggs inside the incubator. It is crucially important to control humidity in an incubator because the eggs hatching hugely depends on the right values. This will result in more water evaporating, which increases the humidity a lot. This method is useful if you want to increase the humidity level in a larger portion during a short period. With a full picture window and LCD display to view the temperature and humidity, this unit makes a great choice for classrooms, novices and experts.

If you live in a very humid area, your incubators might also attract more humidity from the outside. My apologies for the late reply.
