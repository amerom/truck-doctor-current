No subsea well installations have yet been proposed. In addition, the gas compression facilities had not been operating consistently and the platform had not achieved sustained production at its design capacity for any significant period. Prior to September 22, 2003, the Weekly Activity Reports for Geophysical and Geological Surveys , Exploration Wells, Delineation Wells and Development Wells were displayed separately. Revenue ton-miles (RTMs) represent a better proxy of workload than carloads as this metric takes into account the length of haul of the movement. CNLOPB Weekly Activity Report - March 9, 2020. The Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board granted approval to restart on Monday afternoon. Ontario reports record of over 900 coronavirus cases as new restrictions announced. Water associated with oil and gas reservoirs that is produced along with the oil and gas. The Board administers the following rates: The Maximum Safety Related Capacity is the maximum oil or gas rate at which the platform may be operated. 09, 2020. Alberta Energy Regulator suspends environmental monitoring for oilpatch due to COVID-19 pandemic. The concrete production structure fixed to the sea floor by its own weight and which supports the topsides facilities. At The Maritimes Energy Association, we promote the vibrant, diverse Canadian East Coast energy industry and the local supply chain that supports it in a changing global environment. Having considered the information provided by the Proponent in support of the Application, the Board approved the proposed production rate increase, subject to the condition that its approval will be reviewed and may be suspended or revoked should the Proponent’s operations depart significantly from those projected in the Application or if reservoir performance differs significantly from that predicted in the Proponent’s document entitled  “Technical Support for Hibernia Field Rate Increase”. The Board approves the Proponent’s application to increase the average daily oil production rate to 28 600 m3/d (180,000 b/d) in the two stages proposed by the Proponent, subject to Condition 2000.01.01 set out below and the conditions contained in its Decision Reports 86.01, 90.01 and 97.01, the outstanding conditions of which are summarized in Sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 below. A3 Hibernia Benefits Plan Decision 86.01 Status. The Board notes that the higher production rate will not result in any increase in the volume of gas flared. The first development well was spudded in the field in July 1997, and first oil production began on November 17, 1997. As no new information was available for the Ben Nevis/Avalon reservoir, the reservoir simulation model for that reservoir remained unchanged from that presented in the 1996 development plan amendment. In addition, the Proponent provided information confirming that the Hibernia platform has been producing at its design capacity and that both gas compression systems have been operating on a continuous basis since November 4, 1999. In its January 24, 2000 submission, the Proponent also requested a change in certain operating limits established by the Board in the interest of safety. Gravity Base Structure. While the Board does not consider this matter falls within the scope of the development plan, this report records, for the purpose of completeness, that it approved the Proponent’s request on February 16, 2000. The Board has reviewed the Proponent’s Application to determine whether the proposed production increase would affect the environmental impact predictions made in the Proponent’s 1985 Hibernia Environmental Impact Statement, or any of the conditions established by the Board in Decision 86.01. 2.3.2   Development Plan Approval and Project Agreements. Subsequently, on January 24, 2000, the Proponent requested approval to increase the currently authorized average daily oil production rate of 21 450 m3/d (135,000 barrels/day) to 27,000 m3/d (170,000 barrels/day) immediately and to increase the rate further to 28 600 m3/d (180,000 barrels/day) following completion of testing of minor equipment modifications to the facilities scheduled to be completed in March 2000. That the Proponent file for approval by the Board, prior to commencement of development drilling, a specific drilling schedule designed to reduce gas flaring to limits acceptable to the Board; that in the unlikely event that reservoir conditions prevent gas-reinjection, the Proponent present to the Board for approval a plan for gas disposal; and. Early in 1986, the Canada-Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Board (the Board) considered an application by Mobil Oil Canada Ltd., (Mobil) on behalf of the participants in the Hibernia field for approval of its Hibernia Benefits Plan and its Hibernia Development Plan. The effect of approving these proposals would be to increase the authorized maximum annual production from about 7.8 million cubic metres (49.2 million barrels) to 10.4 million cubic metres (65.6 million barrels). As is discussed later and shown in Table 6, the Proponent’s reduction in the original oil-in-place estimates is more than offset by the increased oil recovery that results from better reservoir quality than was originally anticipated. Condition #15 That the Proponent provide periodically to the Board, during the execution of the project, in a form to be prescribed, estimates of the expected capital cost for the project as a whole and for those major components which the Board shall request. A secondary recovery method for injecting gas which is either naturally rich in or is enriched with intermediate hydrocarbons such as propane, butane. Following approval of the 1990 Update, HMDC conducted a second 3-D seismic survey over the Hibernia field and conducted a thorough review of the geology, geophysics and reservoir characteristics that formed the basis of the Development Plan Amendment. Table 1 provides a comparison of the oil-in-place estimates for the Hibernia Reservoir contained in the 1996 Development Plan Amendment with the estimates contained in this Application. Weekly Public Status Report Oil and Gas Activities Offshore Newfoundland and Labrador Issued as of: September 5, 2005 (Also available on the Internet //www.cnlopb.nl.ca) GEOSCIENTIFIC PROGRAMS Program Number Operator/Survey (Location) Vessel/ Contractor: Start Date: Kms Completed Total Planned) Comments: 8924-C047-002E Chevron Canada Resources Orphan Basin 3D seismic survey: … In August 1996, the Board conditionally approved the Proponent’s drilling schedule and volumes of gas to be flared during start-up and transition to steady state operations. National News: ‘Pragmatism over pride’: Suncor no longer a dividend aristocrat — and others may follow suit. The Board, in consultation with the Proponent, will determine which of these major contracts and purchase orders will be subject to Board review. The Proponent therefore projects that it is feasible to achieve an average daily oil production rate of between 28 600 and 30 200 m3/d (180,000 and 190,000 b/d). The Board declared the Hibernia field to be a Commercial Discovery in January 1990 and issued a 25-year Production License in respect of the field on March 21, 1990. Production of petroleum from more than one pool through a common wellbore or flow line without separate measurement of petroleum. Article by Canada-Newfoundland & Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board Pursuant to the Acts , the Board is responsible for the administration of legislation governing hydrocarbon exploration and production in the Newfoundland offshore area. Bodies licensed by the Board to conduct examination of designs, plans and facilities and to issue Certificates of Fitness. Notably, drift blocks are not mentioned (and were presumably not used to assess spill damage to seabirds). Records. The Board attached five conditions to its 1986 approval of the Hibernia Benefits Plan. Why Alberta's devotion to oil is making tech companies want to leave the province. CNLOPB Weekly Activity Report - March 30, 2020. The model was then used to study the effects of production at three different peak production rates, 21 600, 28 600 and 31 800 m3/d (135,860, 180,000 and 200,000 b/d), respectively. While the same volume of oil can be expected to be recovered ultimately at all peak production rates; producing at a higher peak rate means larger volumes are recovered sooner. Decision 90.01 records the Board’s approval. 2.3.2  Development Plan Approval and Project Agreements, 4.1  Hibernia Development Plan Amendment Decision 00.01, OUTSTANDING CONDITIONS FROM DECISIONS 97.01, 90.01 AND 86.01, Figure 2   Hibernia Reservoir “B” Pool Fault Blocks, Figure 3   Hibernia Field Pool and Zone Designations Hibernia Formation, Figure 4   Ben Nevis/Avalon Reservoir Fault Blocks and Proposed Well Locations, Figure 5   Comparison of the Proponent’s Production Forecasts, Figure 6   Proposed Hibernia Field Production Forecast, Table 1   Hibernia Reservoir: Original Oil-in-Place Estimates, Table 2   Hibernia Reservoir Gas Cap: Original Gas-in-Place Estimates, Table 3   Comparison of Average Reservoir Properties: 1996 Development Plan and the Current Model, Table 4   Hibernia Field Reservoir Simulation: Comparison of Cumulative Oil Recovery at Production Rates of 21 600, 28 600 and 31 800 m, Table 5   Hibernia Reservoir Comparison of Oil Recovery Efficiency after 25 years, Table 6   Comparison of Oil Recovery after 25 years: High Rate Case and 1996 Amendment, • Murphy Atlantic Offshore Oil Company Limited, • Chevron Hibernia Holding Company Corporation. APPENDIX A OUTSTANDING CONDITIONS FROM DECISIONS 97.01, 90.01 AND 86.01, A1 Hibernia Development Plan Amendment Decision 97.01. Well drilled for the purpose of production or observation or for the injection or disposal of fluid into or from a petroleum accumulation. that the Proponent obtain the Board’s approval to flare those small volumes of gas needed for normal operations. that the design iceberg scour depth be determined by the Proponent and approved by the Board prior to the design of subsea well installations. One year following the commencement of gas injection, the proponent shall submit a revised forecast of the natural gas liquids production. The Board may set production rate limitations on wells to prevent waste. Also, process whereby information regarding subsurface geological structures may be deduced from sound signals transmitted through the earth. Revised Hibernia water and gas flood programs. The participants built two dedicated ice-reinforced shuttle tankers to transport oil from the field. Is a natural underground reservoir containing or appearing to contain an accumulation of petroleum that is separated or appears to be separated from any such other accumulation. CN reports weekly volumes by AAR grouping (carloads) and by CN reported Business Units (RTMs and carloads). At that level, the estimated annual system operating efficiency of between 90 to 95 percent yields a potential daily production rate of between 28 600 and 30 200 m3/d (180,000 to 190,000 barrels/day). In support of its request for approval of an increase in the average daily production rate, the Proponent updated its geological and geophysical interpretations and its reservoir simulation model for the Hibernia reservoir to incorporate the drilling and production data acquired from wells Hibernia B-16 1 through 11. Higher production rates from individual wells. The Proponent designed its facilities so that export lines will be capable of being flushed, and, in a May 1997 submission to the Board, described its proposed procedures for flushing the risers in the offshore loading system. Also, the rate at which water can be injected in the injection wells has been higher than expected, and the water injection facilities have proven themselves capable of sustaining higher injection rates than those planned in 1996. It also required the Proponent to demonstrate that both gas compression systems on the Hibernia platform were capable of operating on a continuous basis and that the platform was capable of operating continuously at the currently approved design capacity of 24 000 m3/d (150,000 barrels/day). The reservoir pressure below which dissolved gas begins to bubble out of the host oil at the prevailing temperature conditions. The Facility Maximum Daily Production Rate is the oil or gas production rate at which the facility can maintain stable production operations with sufficient reserve capacity to accommodate operational upsets without exceeding the Maximum Safety Related Capacity of the platform. According to the Proponent, the well performance data clearly indicate that the reservoir has the capability to produce at a higher rate than was originally estimated. The submission of the 1996 Hibernia Development Plan Amendment constitutes a revised plan for development of the Avalon reservoir. These negotiations culminated in the signing of a Statement of Principles by the partners and the Federal and Provincial Governments on July 18, 1988. that the Proponent undertake studies, concurrent with initial development drilling, to establish the feasibility of a miscible flood for the Hibernia reservoir. It also concurs with the Proponent’s statements concerning production and injection well performance. Soccer players Danielle Younker and Mohammad Jaber are the UPEI Panthers Subway athletes of the week. The Proponent provides this information to the Board, in accordance with the C-NOPB  Procurement Reporting Guidelines:  Hibernia Development Project. According to the Proponent, the quality of the Hibernia reservoir is better than was predicted in the 1996 Amendment. On a semi-annual basis, the Proponent’s Canada-Newfoundland Benefits Department provides capital cost expenditure forecasts and associated estimates of Canada-Newfoundland content levels which are expected to be achieved. Such amendments also require the approval of both Ministers. That the Proponent design the export lines and loading platforms so that they can be flushed of hydrocarbons if there is risk of damage to those facilities; and. While the Board does not consider that this matter falls within the scope of the development plan, for purposes of completeness, it is recording in this report that it conditionally approved this change on February 16, 2000. Before making a decision on the proposed rate increase, the Board requested the Proponent to submit the results of its testing program for review. In considering the Application, the Board required the Proponent to: The Proponent completed the high production rate testing to confirm the Hibernia platform capacity in December 1999 and provided the results of the tests to the Board in January 2000. The effect of these proposals would be to increase the authorized maximum annual production from about 7.8 million cubic metres (49.2 million barrels) to 10.4 million cubic metres (65.6 million barrels). The Proponent’s simulation studies suggest that increasing the production rate will not adversely affect oil recovery. Commingled production of two zones in the ‘B’ pools of the Hibernia reservoir, Revised estimates of reserves, recovery efficiencies, and production, and. Study of reservoir properties from various logging methods. Canadian Production. The Proponent completed the high rate testing program to confirm the capacity of the Hibernia platform and identify the modifications to facilities needed to achieve the proposed production rate increase in December 1999. The Development Plan contains a detailed description of the project. National News: Draft wage-subsidy bill gives businesses more flexibility to measure revenue decline. This report constitutes the Board’s conditional approval of the Proponent’s application to increase the currently authorized average daily oil production rate of 21 450 m3/d (135,000 barrels/day) to 27 000 m3/d (170,000 barrels/day) immediately and to increase that rate further to 28 600 m3/d (180,000 barrels/day) after successful completion of the testing of minor equipment modifications that are currently in progress. The Board may also reduce this rate for safety purposes or to prevent waste. This report constitutes the Board’s conditional approval of the Proponent’s application to increase the currently authorized average daily oil production rate of 21 450 m 3 /d (135,000 barrels/day) to 27 000 m 3 /d (170,000 barrels/day) immediately and to increase that rate further to 28 600 m 3 /d (180,000 barrels/day) after successful completion of the testing of minor equipment modifications that are …  Production profile for each case a Petroleum accumulation received results of the Hibernia project significantly than.
