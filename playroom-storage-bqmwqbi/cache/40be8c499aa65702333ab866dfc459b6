This projectile sheds a lot of weight and can flatten out or shed its core, all of which leads to massive hydraulic and mechanical wounding action. To this end, I would suggest that when using projectiles weighing up to 240 grains the .444 is perhaps best sighted 2” high at 100 yards for a zero roughly around 170 yards and a drop of around 2 to 2.5” at 200 yards. That aside, the .444 boasts massive hydraulic force potential at close ranges rendering very large, fast bleeding internal wounds. As with the original Remington load, Hornady chose a flat soft point projectile in an attempt to avoid the problems that can occur when driving hollow point .44 projectiles at high velocities. Those who wish to exploit the high velocity wounding potential of lighter weight projectiles are advised to trial conventional 200 grain bullets on game no heavier (or not much heavier) than 60kg (132lb) or to utilize a core bonded bullet (e.g modified 210 grain Speer Gold Dot) for body weights up to and around 80kg (176lb).
