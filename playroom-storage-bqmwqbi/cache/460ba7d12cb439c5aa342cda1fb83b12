However, a study of trophy hunting by the University of Zimbabwe supports claims of conservation success tied to responsible hunting practices. Gunn, 2001; Naidoo et al., 2016). Trophy hunting could keep conservation in business. Now a member of the IUCN, the Wild Sheep Foundation is expanding its efforts in the world’s largest and most diverse habitat for the animals—the remote republics of Central Asia. PETER A. LINDSEY. Trophy hunting is by no means a perfect solution, but the IUCN Cat Specialists Group says, “Properly managed trophy hunting was viewed as an important solution to long-term lion conservation.” There will always be some abuse from unscrupulous individuals. The IUCN guidelines (IUCN, 2012) outline that, as a conservation tool, trophy hunting should create equitable net conservation benefits for local human communities co‐existing with wildlife populations. In the case of lions, there have been concerns about increasing infanticides and population decline due to replacements of the dominant males caused by selective hunting (Kiffner, 2008; Packer et al., 2009; Whitman et al., 2004). Scientifically sound data on biological and socio‐economic consequences of trophy hunting should be provided for a comprehensive ethical judgment of trophy hunting under the utilitarian framework (Macdonald et al., 2017; Treves et al., 2018). Trophy Hunting Is Good for Conservation, Says IUCN Report. Trophy hunting is by no means a perfect solution, but the IUCN Cat Specialists Group says, “Properly managed trophy hunting was viewed as an important solution to long-term lion conservation.” There will always be some abuse from unscrupulous individuals. For example, the recent discussions of trophy hunting in African countries bring up a completely different set of issues than those we deal with in the US. Also, some reports showed that trophy hunting, on average, accounted for only 1.8% of the total annual revenue from tourism (equal to 0.004% of GDP) in nine major sub‐Saharan African countries (Campbell, 2013; also see UNWTO, 2014). These consequences can undermine public trust in conservation. Claire Palmer (Texas A&M University) and Chelsea Batavia (Oregon State University) for their comments on the earlier versions of the manuscript. In any case, the burden of proof is on trophy hunting advocates to show that these rules are followed to assure maximizing utility to all affected. The contribution of hunting tourism: How significant is this to National Economies? Such activity is fully in line with the North American Wildlife Conservation Model that spells out the importance of management in balancing all wildlife populations so they may be sustained and continue to thrive. argue that banning trophy hunting would be detrimental to conservation. Harvey says trophy hunting is typically defended under a “consequentialist moral framework”. Scott points out that Timbavati “relies on income generated from two forms of sustainable utilisation — photographic tourism and trophy hunting”. But it remains unclear in exactly what circumstances trophy hunting produces a valuable conservation benefit. Another concern regarding the socio‐economic impacts of trophy hunting is that of corruption and inequitable distribution of benefits (Leader‐Williams et al., 2009).1 Studies have revealed that, in some cases, local communities’ share in trophy hunting revenues is minimal and reduced by corruption (Baldus & Cauldwell, 2004; Campbell, 2013; Dube, 2019; Grijalva, 2016; Lindsey, 2008; Nelson et al., 2013; Nordbø et al., 2018; Sachedina, 2008). Even Jeremy Bentham, the father of modern utilitarianism, suggested that the capacity for suffering entitles animals to equal consideration of moral interests (Bentham, 1780/1948). Furthermore, poor management and ineffective policies in trophy hunting have been shown to contribute to the decline of endangered species (e.g. This report demonstrated that the total number of 15,000 trophy hunting‐related jobs generated in Africa is insignificant, again considering that the population of the eight primary big game hunting countries was 150 million people with a vast area of their land (16.5%) dedicated to hunting. Trophy Hunting and Conservation. In his ‘convergence hypothesis’, Norton (1991) argues that at the policy level, the implications of environmental holism and anthropocentrism converge, even though proponents of holism have commonly argued that anthropocentrism is not a sound basis for an environmental ethic. This argument depends in part on the generation of significant income from the trophy hunters, which, it is claimed, can then be reinvested into conservation activities. #ConservationFirst #ConservationMatters #Sheep ...

Moreover, fuelled by rising auction prices, captive breeding of trophy animals affected biodiversity by having evolutionary consequences such as inbreeding in animal populations (Castley et al., 2001) and artificially creating ‘new species’ through hybridization, splitting and crossbreeding (e.g. While trophy hunting often brings in money to certain parks or locations, it's counterproductive to the overall idea of conservation. L. G. FRANK. see Koot, 2019), and Cameroon (e.g. Indeed, roots of the public outrage against trophy hunting after events like the hunting of Cecil or the recent case of Skye (an iconic male lion from the Kruger National Park) might be found in the violence and brutality involved in those actions (see Actman, 2016; Louw & Pickover, 2018; Malone, 2018; Nelson et al., 2016). Removing economic incentive for Africans to conserve lions has been demonstrated to be disastrous. Consequently, the public backlash can lead to outcomes that have a negative impact on conservation, such as reducing individuals’ willingness to contribute to conservation or losing their support for conservation policies (López‐Bao et al., 2017; Wilson, 2008). This research did not receive any funding or financial support. Complementary benefits of tourism and hunting to communal conservancies in Namibia. Africa for sale? Read more. While the debate in Washington regarding the best way to conserve wildlife continues, animal rights groups stoke the fires of emotionalism surrounding H.R. Proponents of trophy hunting argue that it is good for conservation and for the development of marginalised people. Another piece of literature, again based on observations of social media, argued that trophy hunting is a signalling behaviour involving show‐off and display, amplified by social media, to achieve social status and prestige (Darimont et al., 2017). That’s a typical concern for assessments that rely on self-report. The conservation group Conservation Force is funded by hunting interests and has gained access to CITES meetings, sat on key IUCN committees, and influenced a number of major decisions affecting threatened wildlife. I do believe, however, that a rule utilitarian approach could endorse the practice if various specific rules were effectively enforced: (a) trophy hunting must not jeopardize wildlife populations, alter natural selection and ecosystem functioning, or diminish native biodiversity; (b) trophy hunting must create equitable net conservation benefits to the local community that are not available through alternative ethical practices; (c) trophy hunting must not contribute to social inequality and injustice; (d) trophy hunting must consider animal welfare and minimize sentient animals' suffering and (e) trophy hunting must not cause public outrage and undermine public trust in conservation. It is part of a concerted effort by the industry to peddle the lie that shooting animals for ‘sport’ is ‘conservation’. However, what is most relevant when discussing trophy hunting and its role in conservation should be its final outcome on wildlife populations. These consequences can have adverse effects on the happiness of present or future animals or humans. Furthermore, according to the IUCN report (IUCN/PACO, 2009), in the 10 big game hunting countries (excluding South Africa), the average turnover of big game hunting equalled to $US1.1/ha, out of which only $US0.10/ha went to the local communities.

Macdonald, Jacobsen, et al., 2016; Nelson et al., 2016) merits consideration as a negative outcome in an utilitarian analysis of trophy hunting. Conny Damm photo, Engineers are working to modify car headlights to reduce deer collisions—when cars are better lit, deer can see them sooner, which reduces car-deer collisions by 25%. Here I review evidence from the literature that undermines the benefits associated with the practice of trophy hunting. Examples of why trophy hunting is not true conservation: Lion populations have declined sharply in the last three decades, across Africa, due to threats such as habitat loss, retaliatory killings, snares set by poachers and increasing demand for lion bones and body parts from China.

Is trophy hunting of bharal (blue sheep) and Himalayan tahr contributing to their conservation in Nepal? Jan 2, 2020 | Conservation. Animal welfare considerations (when understood in terms of the feelings of sentient animals; see Jones, 2013; Morris, 2020; Sekar & Shiller, 2020) need to be accounted for, particularly in cases where trophy animals suffer from a painful death, as well as instances where culling an animal causes a feeling of grief in its conspecifics (see Flynn, 2019). Beyond castration and culling: Should we use non‐surgical, pharmacological methods to control the sexual behavior and reproduction of animals? Moreover, trophy hunting activities should not modify ecosystems in a way that diminishes native biodiversity. email palindsey@gmail.com palindsey@gmail.com.Search for more papers by this author .

In a similar vein, links have been found between lacking empathy for animals and lacking empathy for humans (Taylor & Signal, 2005). 4804), Engineers are working to modify car headlights to reduce deer collisions—when cars are better lit, deer can see them sooner, which reduces car-deer collisions by 25%. Such activity is fully in line with the North American Wildlife Conservation Model that spells out the importance of management in balancing all wildlife populations so they may be sustained and continue to thrive. SUBSCRIBE. This paper explains how trophy hunting, if well managed, can play a positive role in supporting conservation as well as local community rights and livelihoods, and provides examples from various parts of the world. That is, the old conservation methods should be altered to accommodate new public values and demands (e.g. It has been assigned to the House Committee on Natural Resources. As Lovering (2006) replied to Jensen (2001), the moral standing of animals casts doubt on the morality of hunting them and all the virtues expressed thereby.

See MoreSee Less, Regulated hunting is an important tool of wildlife managers, and hunting organizations play an important role in lobbying for conservation. Given the controversies around trophy hunting, it is surprising that there are only a few scientific studies exploring trophy hunters’ motives and intentions. Avoiding future bans is thus vital for conservation.” When local communities are not incentivized to protect lions they are subsequently killed. see Yasuda, 2011). 3 Minute Read. It is not trophy hunting but predator management. Why Men Trophy … Trophy Hunting: Confronting the Elephant (Head) in the Room. Any queries (other than missing content) should be directed to the corresponding author for the article. In another work, Ahmad (2016) stated that trophy hunting had only been discussed from the utilitarian ethical perspective. Peter Lindsey, the lead author of the study, wrote, “trophy hunting is sustainable and low risk if well managed.” Lindsey continued, “Trophy hunting was banned in Kenya in 1977, in Tanzania during 1973–1978, and in Zambia from 2000 through 2003. He rejected utilitarianism and explained that since animals and the environment have intrinsic values, it is our duty to protect them, without expecting incentives or benefits. Manfredo et al., 2009, 2020), driven by forces of modernization (Manfredo et al., 2016, 2020). The baby and the bathwater: trophy hunting, conservation and rural livelihoods. Thus, the review of ethical concerns provided in this essay suggests that, when a sufficiently broad range of ethical concerns is considered, the practice of trophy hunting looks to be ethically problematic from all the three ethical frameworks. CAMPFIRE in Zimbabwe, see Dube, 2019; or communal conservancies in Namibia, see Hannis, 2016; Koot, 2019). They value protecting individual animals over actions that favor preservation of species. In ethics, various deontological formulations exist, and some ethicists have applied them to analyse hunting, in general, and often rejected its morality (with some exceptions like subsistence or traditional indigenous hunting; e.g. As the studies above imply, whether trophy hunters' motivations and intentions associate with nurturing and practicing the kinds of virtues that contribute to living a flourishing human life is dubious. It is noteworthy that the mentioned virtues of humility, connectedness to nature, gratitude and respect for nature and animals can also be attained through other non‐consumptive nature‐based activities, such as hiking and nature photography (Duffus & Dearden, 1990). 4804 not only seeks to prevent the hunting of lions or any species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), but would undermine captive breeding projects that were exempted from ESA by the Obama Administration; projects that have successfully saved the scimitar-horned oryx, and other endangered hoof stock from extinction— returning them to the African savannah. Furthermore, there should be social and cultural benefits associated with trophy hunting based on accountable and effective governance and adaptive management. Peter Lindsey, the lead author of the study, wrote, “trophy hunting is sustainable and low risk if well managed.” Lindsey continued, “Trophy hunting was banned in Kenya in 1977, in Tanzania during 1973–1978, and in Zambia from 2000 through 2003. Visit the Conservation Frontlines Video Library for documentaries from around the globe on wildlife conservation and how rural communities protect their natural resources. For instance, Gunn (2001) argued that trophy hunting provides monetary incentives for local communities to protect wildlife, and integrates conservation and development. By those criteria, true subsistence hunting can be justified, but not trophy hunting. Therefore, trophy hunting appears to be ethically problematic under a virtue ethics framework. Reindeer hunters in Siberia found the remains of a mummified cave bear—the only one ever discovered that still has its soft tissue, including fur and even its black nose. by Phil Phillips - Monday, April 25, 2016. Around the world, she has observed people’s strong feelings about nature, their environment and animals. These studies, approaching the subject from different ethical perspectives, have reached different conclusions. After years of guiding, outfitting and hosting outdoor programming, I've had ample opportunity to defend trophy hunting and the hunters' role in wildlife conservation, always surprised at how often poaching is confused with trophy hunting. In South Africa, most hunting reserves are former cattle ranches that were converted to wildlife conservation after legal changes allowed landowners to hold property rights in wildlife. The IUCN guidelines provide a structure to analyse trophy hunting consequences thoroughly. There were individuals who would pay to enjoy performing the executions and the money raised could be spent on humanitarian efforts. This habitat conservation is a direct result of the fact that trophy hunting can be profitable for landowners and community members. The IUCN Council was split, some councilors sided with the IFAW position. Sandler (2017) enumerates maleficence towards nonhuman living things, cruelty towards animals and lack of compassion for them among the environmental vices. The need to make conservation more inclusive while strengthening the field sports through activism—a conservation scientist’s viewpoint. Also, I assume that a flourishing human life involves developing and maintaining good relationships both with other human beings in civil society and with the animals and natural environments on which human civilizations depend (Hursthouse, 2009). Just conservation: What is it and should we pursue it? Finally, research has revealed social inequalities emerging as consequences of trophy and game hunting, for instance, in South Africa (e.g. Deregulating conservation Eduardo Gonçalves, founder of the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting, said: “Hunting lobbyists are presenting themselves as conservationists. Few things stoke the fires of emotion like the idea of endangered species dying unnecessarily. tigers; Snijders, 2018), game protective fencing (Woodroffe et al., 2014) and removing predators to protect trophy animals (Pirie et al., 2017), all in response to trophy hunting demand, have deteriorated local biodiversity. To provide a framework for elaborating on the biological and socio‐economic concerns about trophy hunting, I borrow the IUCN guiding principles on trophy hunting (IUCN, 2012). The letter stated that hunting has many positive impacts on conservation, and Amy Dickman, one of the letter’s lead authors, appeared on the BBC, where she stated that imposing a complete trophy hunting ban is likely to cause “more animals to die.”, Kitty Block, CEO of the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), is critical of the Science letter. Read more. Well done, Prince William. Ethics plays a fundamental role in justifying conservation activities (Minteer & Miller, 2011) so that some scholars consider conservation as an ethically driven science (e.g. It is not unreasonable to speculate that increasing social pressure and shifts in public attitudes will result in condemnation and restriction of trophy hunting activities in the foreseeable future. We constantly add new items, so come back often , The snow leopard is facing extinction due to habitat loss, poaching and climate change. In this way, trophy hunters can obtain their trophies and, at the same time, conservation can benefit through, for instance, GPS tagging the animals (see Cove, 2018 for details). In this essay, I refer to trophy hunting as it is practiced by the Western world and claimed to promote conservation. Tropical Resource Ecology Programme, University of Zimbabwe, Box 167, Mt. Given such widely acknowledged problems with act utilitarian reasoning, and given that my concern in this paper is with the practice of trophy hunting as a type of activity that is rule‐governed (by laws or policy documents), in this section, I consider trophy hunting from a rule utilitarian perspective. We recommend: (1) temporal and spatial rotational resting of hunting areas to create refuge to improve trophy quality and maintenance of genetic diversity, and (2) introduction of variable trophy fee pricing system based on trophy size. Hunting advocates say the only chance for survival of the lions is management as a valuable and sustainable natural resource.

Similar effects have been observed on impalas, greater kudus and sable antelopes in Africa (Crosmary et al., 2013; Muposhi et al., 2016), as well as Cape buffalo and elephants (Muposhi et al., 2016). The available evidence is conflicting and casts doubt on the utilitarian assumptions that trophy hunting is often based on. Additionally, skewed sex ratios and age structures due to selective harvesting of large mammals may cause rapid evolution, in addition to other adverse evolutionary outcomes (Aryal et al., 2015; Mysterud, 2011).
