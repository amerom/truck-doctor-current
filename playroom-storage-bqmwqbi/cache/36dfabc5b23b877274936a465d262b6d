A US Army report on anti-aircraft guns of April 1917 reported that this gun's semi-automatic loading system was discontinued because of difficulties of operation at higher angles of elevation, and replaced by "the standard Vickers-type straight-pull breech mechanism", reducing rate of fire from 22 to 20 rds/minute. These (Mk I) included the introduction of a vertical sliding breech-block to allow semi-automatic operation. ISBN 1-870114-05-1, Brigadier NW Routledge, History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery. By the time of the US entry into World War II, the 3-inch M3 was in the process of being replaced and may have seen action in the Pacific during World War II. SKU: Britgun10 Categories: Anti-Aircraft guns and equipments, Anti-Aircraft guns and equipments Brand: EWM. The barrel can be elevated by the elevating hand wheel. The other used a travelling platform (Mounting Mk II) with detachable wheels for guns to be used in static positions but which could be re-positioned. The Navy provided the initial 3-inch (76 mm) guns from its warships, approximately 18 by December 1914, for the defence of key installations in Britain, manned by RNVR crews, until the new specialised anti-aircraft version began production and entered service. The Ordnance QF 32 pounder was developed from the 3.7-inch gun and armed the Tortoise self-propelled gun. In 1928, the general characteristics for a new HAA gun were agreed, a bore of 3.7 inches (94 mm) firing 25 lb (11 kg) shells with a ceiling of 28,000 feet (8,500 m). The QF 3.7-inch AA was Britain's primary heavy anti-aircraft gun  during World War II. The carriage's short recoil of 11 inches (280 mm) allowed a higher rate of fire than for AA guns based on long-recoil field guns such as the QF 13 pounder 9 cwt. The last such shoot was on May 31, 1941, during the North Strand bombing in which 31 civilians were killed. The 3.7-Inch QF AA was Britain's primary heavy anti-aircraft gun during Second World War. The mounting and recuperating gear were also not designed to handle the strain of prolonged firing at low elevations. For Army 3-inch gun see 3-inch M1918 gun. A total of 212 of these HAA regiments, Royal Artillery, plus two each for the Royal Marines[citation needed] and Royal Malta Artillery[citation needed], were eventually formed. The gun was produced in six major variants. This was faster and could track targets at 400 mph (640 km/h) at heights of 25,000 ft (7,600 m), both Predictors received height data, generally from the Barr & Stroud UB 7 (9 feet base) instrument.[12]. The 3 inch 20 cwt gun was superseded by the QF 3.7 inch AA gun from 1938 onwards but numbers of various Marks remained in service throughout World War II. The wheels were lifted off the ground or removed when the gun was brought into action. As a result a search for suitable anti-aircraft guns began. You must purchase the image from Stocktrek Images in order to use it for ANY other purpose. Beginning in 1930, a new towed 4-wheeled sprung trailer platform was introduced to replace the obsolete lorries still used as mounts from World War I, together with modern new barrels, and equipment to connect the guns to the new Vickers No. [9] Routledge quotes a rate of fire of 16-18 rounds per minute, in the context of the 16 pounder shell of 1916. Some of the substantial numbers of spare barrels required were produced in Canada. In British service, the gun replaced the 3-inch AA gun in HAA batteries of the Royal Artillery, almost always in HAA regiments, which were usually in an anti-aircraft brigade. Note the substantial gun crew and the size of the gun. However, the war had shown the possibilities and potential for air attack and lessons had been learned. The gun was based on a prewar Vickers naval 3-inch (76 mm) QF gun with modifications specified by the War Office in 1914. The Mark II lost the semi-automatic action. [27], British Commonwealth Naval weapons of the, Weapons of comparable role, performance and era, Notes on Anti-Aircraft Guns. The 3"/50 caliber gun (spoken "three-inch-fifty-caliber") in United States naval gun terminology indicates the gun fired a projectile 3 inches (7.62 cm) in diameter, and the barrel was 50 calibers long (barrel length is 3" x 50 = 150" or 3.81 meters).

In the firing position the chasis is lowered to the ground and supported by four outriggers with pads which level the gun into the correct firing position. Reviews (2) 2 reviews for QF 3 Inch 20 cwt Anti-Aircraft gun on 4 wheel trailer with. In 1925, the RAF established a new command, Air Defence of Great Britain, and the Royal Artillery's anti-aircraft units were placed under its command. 8 more Mks followed between the World Wars. The mounting had a pedestal that was fixed to a solidly constructed, preferably concrete, platform on the ground. During World War I, anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft gunnery developed rapidly. London: Brassey's, This page was last edited on 1 December 2020, at 21:50. One wood and brass model of a 3-inch, 50 caliber anti-aircraft gun mount. These were known as Pile platforms, after the head of Anti-Aircraft Command, General Frederick Alfred Pile.[9]. When war broke out and Germany occupied Belgium and North-east France, it was realised that key installations at home could be attacked by air. Mechanical, as opposed to igniferous, time fuzes were required because the speed of powder burning varied with height so fuze length was not a simple function of time of flight. The gun was produced in two versions, one mobile and another fixed. The 3-inch M3 gun was the primary anti-aircraft weapon of the US Army and Marines at the beginning of World War II. It was also fitted to older destroyers, A to I classes during refits in 1940, replacing a set of torpedo tubes, to increase their AA capabilities. The main equipment of the Heavy Anti Aircraft artillery was the 3.7 inch Anti Aircraft gun which came in two versions, static and mobile. By the end of World War I, 257 (out of a total of 402 AA guns) were in land service in England on static and lorry mountings, and 102 (out of a total of 348) were in service on the Western Front[19] mounted on heavy lorries, typically the Peerless 4 Ton. Fuze No.199 was igniferous (i.e. [26] They appear to have been mainly deployed in home defence. £ 150 - 200. 28 September 1939 - 2BW2MEK from Alamy's library of millions of … [6], During the 1920s, Vickers developed the Vickers Predictor, an electro-mechanical computer that took height and range data from an optical rangefinder, applied corrections for non-standard conditions and was used by its operators to visually track a target, its output predicted firing data and fuse setting via the "mag-slip" electrical induction system to dials on each gun in a battery, the gun layers moved the gun to match pointers on the dials.

Air Raid precautions 3 inch anti-aircraft guns in London. The aim of this post is provide some context around this and distinguish two separate issues – use of the gun in the ground role, and use in the anti-tank role. The initial standing orders were that all anti-aircraft positions were to open fire on all unidentified aircraft, which were reasonable targets. Gun, Mk II, https://military.wikia.org/wiki/QF_3-inch_20_cwt?oldid=2566390, high-angle wheeled, static or lorry mounting, Time to 5,000 ft (1,500 m) at 25° (seconds), Time to 10,000 ft (3,000 m) at 40° (seconds), Time to 15,000 ft (4,600 m) at 55° (seconds), A gun captured by Israel from Egypt in the 1956 war, missing breech screw, is displayed at the Clandestine Immigration and Naval Museum, Haifa, Israel. It was used throughout World War II in all theatres except the Eastern Front. [13] It was from then onwards operated by Royal Garrison Artillery crews, with drivers and crew for motor lorries provided by the Army Service Corps. The Army version was designated 3 inch 20 cwt Anti aircraft gun and was mounted on a mobile carriage. £ 15.50 Add to basket; Spent shell cases and piles of ready to fire ammo for £ 1.50 Add to basket The fixed mounting allowed more powerful ammunition, Mk. It was roughly the equivalent of the German 8.8 cm Flak 18 and the American 90 mm flak, but with a slightly larger calibre of 94 mm. Articles incorporating text from Wikipedia, World War I artillery of the United Kingdom, World War II artillery of the United Kingdom, World War I naval weapons of the United Kingdom, World War II naval weapons of the United Kingdom, BRITISH ARTILLERY IN WORLD WAR 2. Two versions of the gun were produced. The 3.7" Anti-Aircraft Gun In the late thirties the British Army were looking for a weapon between the 3" and 4.7" calibre Anti-Aircraft guns. 199 had to be used and its lesser running time limited the effective ceiling. [16] Igniferous fuzes had to have a gaine in order to detonate HE shells. Canada, like Britain, became aware of the need for antiaircraft guns just prior to the start of the First World War. [5], The Mark I* had different rifling. Australia received four of these guns in 1927. April 1917, page 22. Routledge 1994, page 27. [1] By 1934 the rocking-bar deflection sights had been replaced by Magslip receiver dials which received input from the Predictor, with the layers matching pointers instead of tracking the target. Automated fire ensured a constant rate of fire that made it easier to predict where each shell should be individually aimed. Production began in 1937 and it was used throughout World War II in all theatres except the Eastern Front. The gun was also used as the basis for the Ordnance QF 32-pounder anti-tank gun variant used on the Tortoise heavy assault tank. Production began in 1937 and it was used throughout World War II in all theatres except the Eastern Front. The three-inch AA guns were modified accordingly.[6]. This is a Stocktrek Images licensable image titled 'Medium shot t of military soldiers firing a 3-inch anti-aircraft gun.'. The QF (quick-firing) 3.7-inch (94 mm) AA gun was Britain's primary heavy anti-aircraft gun during World War II; unlike the German 88 mm gun, it was not adapted as an anti-tank weapon. The British Army eventually adopted the QF 3-inch 20 cwt as the most commonly used type. Anti-Aircraft Artillery, 1914-55. Date Taken not specified Geotag not specified Other World War II users were India (about 14 regiments), Canada (two or three regiments), East and West Africa (five regiments), and Australia (equivalent of about 13 regiments). Once the Germans had learned to stand off and suppress the 2-pounders with machine-gun and artillery fire, the guns ceased to be of much value. ANTI-TANK ARTILLERY, Jaeger Platoon: Finnish Army 1918 - 1945 Antiaircraft Guns Part 3: Heavy Guns. London: The Royal Artillery Institution, 1988. 11, on Mounting Mk. After an immediate post-war hiatus, the army re-established peacetime anti-aircraft units in 1922. Like the Mk IV this was based on the 4.5 inch barrel design lined down to 3.7 inches, and using the 4.5 inch size cartridge. 20 cwt referred to the weight of the barrel and breech, to differentiate it from other "3 inch" guns (1 cwt = 1 hundredweight = 112 lb, hence the barrel and breech together weighed 2250 lb). On 1 January 1938, the British air defences had only 180 anti-aircraft guns larger than 50 mm and most of these were the older 3-inch guns. This was the British 3.7-inch (94-mm) anti-aircraft gun, and Lieutenant (later Major) David Parry of the 57th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, for one, felt there was ‘no excuse for the sheer stupidity of the General Staff’ in not allowing it to be used in an anti-tank role…. Production continued until 1945, averaging 228 guns per month throughout the period. The remaining weapons were the six Bofors light anti-aircraft gun and four 3-inch AA guns. The QF 3 inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft gun became the standard anti-aircraft gun used in the home defence of the United Kingdom against German airships and bombers and on the Western Front in World War I.It was also common on British warships in World War I and submarines in World War II. However, the powder burning rate changed as air pressure reduced, making them erratic for the new vertical shooting. 206, was still some years from production. [10] As a result of the development of military airpower during World War I, the Army developed a 3-inch rapid-fire antiaircraft gun, which was distributed to the forts for protection of the batteries. However, Colonel Probert changed the barrel to have gradual rifling: the rifling groove depth decreased to zero over the last five calibres of the barrel before the muzzle. Gun production started the following year. Similar to the Mk IV. During the North African Campaign, the 3.7 was considered for use explicitly as an anti-tank weapon due to the shortage of suitable anti-tank guns. There were six marks of ordnance (the barrel and breech assembly) and a few marks of carriage of both versions, some using letter suffixes. The 3.7 inch Anti Aircraft gun Mark 2 ordnance on Mark 3 chasis is a mobile, purpose built weapons platform. The igniferous No. [7][8] The weight specification was exceeded, the muzzle velocity not achieved and the mechanical time fuze, No. 106 and 107 were mechanical time fuses; both proved unsatisfactory. Canada also experimented with mounting the 3.7-inch gun on the Ram tank chassis. Fuze No. They were used during the Continuation War of 1941 - 1944. The 16 pound shell took 9.2 seconds to reach 5,000 ft (1,500 m) at 25° from horizontal, 13.7 seconds to reach 10,000 ft (3,000 m) at 40°, 18.8 seconds to reach 15,000 at 55°. 1994. It was also used in conjunction with the Predictor No. Rated 5 out of 5. Financial stringency led to no action being taken until the 1930s, when the specification was enhanced to a 28 lb (13 kg) shell, 3,000 ft/s (910 m/s) muzzle velocity, a 35,000 feet (11,000 m) ceiling, a towed road speed of 25 mph (40 km/h), maximum weight of eight tons and an into action time of 15 minutes. IIC and Carriage Mk. It was mounted on the Mounting Mk IIA and therefore deployed in static emplacements only. Image: 3-Inch M3 Anti-Aircraft Gun (U.S. National Archive) Year: 1933: Weapon Type [@type] Origin & Designer [@designer] Numbers Produced: 807: Crew: Sergeant/Squad Leader + .30 cal M1903 Rifle. In World War II the gun was carried by S class, U class and V class submarines.  Each regiment usually had three batteries, each of eight guns in two troops. The Anti-Aircraft Gun That Might Have Been Effective Against the German in the North Africa Desert. Neither vehicle saw service. Deflection was calculated mechanically and graphically using an optical height & rangefinder to provide data for the two piece Wilson-Dalby 'predictor', with the fuze length read off a scale mounted on the gun. Being a high-velocity gun, with a single charge and firing substantial quantities of ammunition, meant that barrel life could be short and by the end of 1940 there was a barrel shortage. See, A gun from the Egyptian ship "El Amir Faruk", sunk in 1948, missing the elevation mechanism, is displayed at the Clandestine Immigration and Naval Museum, Haifa, Israel. The 1916 16 lb shell at 2,000 ft/s (610 m/s) proved ballistically superior and was better suited to a high explosive filling. However, the Mobile Anti-Aircraft Brigade based at Kenwood Barracks in London, continued to be manned by the RNVR, although under the operational control of the Army.[14]. This consisted of a wheeled carriage (Carriage Mk I or Mk III) with four folding outrigger trails and levelling jacks. See, General Sir Martin Farndale, History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery : Forgotten Fronts and the Home Base 1914-18. A 3.7-inch anti-aircraft gun in the Western Desert, 27 June 1941. The 3 inch 20 cwt with its powerful and stable in flight[15] 16 lb (7.3 kg) shell and fairly high altitude was well suited to defending the United Kingdom against high-altitude Zeppelins and bombers. US$ 200 - 260. [17], By June 1916, 202 3 inch 20 cwt were deployed in the air defence of Britain, of a total of 371 AA guns.[3]. 3in M3 ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN. The Mk IIC mounting enabled fully automatic engagements, apart from putting shells into the feed to the machine fuze setter. It was roughly the equivalent of the German 88 mm FlaK  and American 90 mm, but with a slightly larger calibre of 3.7 inches, approximately 94 mm. The carriage included the recoil system, laying arrangements, fuse setting and loading machinery. The QF 3 inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft gun became the standard anti-aircraft gun used in the home defence of the United Kingdom against German airships and bombers and on the Western Front in World War I. ISBN 1-85753-099-3. Handbook of the 3-inch anti-aircraft gun matériel, model of 1918, motorized, with instructions for its care. QF 3 Inch 20 cwt Anti-Aircraft gun on 4 wheel trailer with quantity. [7], The early 12.5 lb (5.7 kg) shrapnel shell at 2,500 ft/s (760 m/s) caused excessive barrel wear and was unstable in flight. However, it did give greatly improved performance against likely aircraft targets, with testing showing that against a target representing a Nakajima plane a single rapid-fire 3"/50 (7.62 cm) was as effective as two 40 mm quad mountings and that it could effectively engage at a much longer range. There were few 3.7-equipped heavy anti-aircraft regiments in the field army and most were not subordinate to divisions where the anti-tank capability was required. The QF 3.7-inch AA was Britain's primary heavy anti-aircraft gun during World War II. This smoothed the two driving bands of a new design shell giving reduced air resistance and hence better ballistic performance, and causing far less barrel wear. Initially, there were HE and shrapnel shells, both fitted with a time fuze. Designed in 1940, the M5 3″ anti-tank gun combined the barrel of the 3-inch anti-aircraft gun T9 with the breech, recoil system and carriage from the 105 mm howitzer M2. First, aimed fire was the primary method and this was enabled by predicting gun data from visually tracking the target with continuous height and range input. Add to basket. One used a travelling carriage, for use by batteries in the field army. 1 Predictor. When the gun recoiled and ran forward after firing, the motion also opened the breech, ejected the empty cartridge and held the breech open ready to reload, with the striker cocked. Britain lagged behind Germany in developing clockwork time fuzes. Download this stock image: War Crisis, 1939. The Mk VI ordnance significantly increased the potential effective ceiling. In 1944, it was found that a temporary platform built from railway sleepers and rails was adequate for the static guns, making them considerably easier to re-deploy without the cost and delay of constructing new concrete platforms. Anti-Aircraft “spotter” with binoculars in chair with £ 1.25 Add to basket; 3.7 inch AA gun ammuntions. In Naval use it was being replaced in the 1920s by the QF 4 inch Mk V on HA (high-angle) mounting. [5] This would appear to be the effective rate of fire found to be sustainable in action. British 12-pdr (3"/45 (76.2 cm)) 20cwt QF HA Marks I, II, III and IV, Diagram of 3 inch 20 cwt gun on Peerless 4 Ton Lorry, 1.59-inch Breech-Loading Vickers Q.F.

This glass plate was used to assist in the adjustment of anti-aircraft firing settings for a 3.7 inch anti-aircraft gun. VI, which gave vastly increased performance. Includes report on 3 inch 20 cwt. Initially most were in the heavy anti-aircraft (HAA) role until replaced by the new 3.7 inch gun. Though heavy to manhandle, it gave US crews significantly better anti-tank capabilities than previous guns. Lead Soldiers. In 1934, Vickers Armstrong produced a mock-up and proceeded to develop prototypes of the weapon, which was selected and passed acceptance tests in 1936. Like other British guns, the 3.7 had a secondary direct fire role for defending its position against tank attack. The first guns arrived on the Western Front in November 1916 and by the end of 1916 it equipped 10 sections out of a total of 91.
