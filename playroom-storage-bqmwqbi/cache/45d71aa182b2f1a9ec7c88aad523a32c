Â Adult plum curculios primarily overwinter in forest leaf litter. 3). Strategies 1, 2, and 3 are strictly organic approaches. One female lays an average of 150 to 200 eggs. Eggs hatch in 3â5 days. It is found in most states east of the Rocky Mountains. Fruit may fall prematurely, in late May and June. Stone fruit are more attractive to it (plum, peach). Apply insecticides when populations of adult beetles are severe. The adults will feed on and damage apples and pears, but few larvae are usually found in these hosts.  The larval stage usually takes 2-3 weeks. About five to six weeks later, adults emerge from the soil to feeâ¦ It overwinters in wooded areas and flies into fruit orchards in the spring.

ID/Life Cycle: The plum curculio (PC) is a typical snout beetle, 1/4 inch-long, dark brown in color. Develops inside protection of fruiting structures. The grub can be found inside infested fruits during June and early July. Its wing covers have four bumps and grayish-white patches. After the female has chosen a suitable host, she will build an egg chamber under the fruit skin to receive the egg. When It is important to delay application of the pesticide until after flower petals drop to avoid harming pollinating insects. One female lays an average of 150 to 200 eggs. Life History 2. Wayne, curculio is an insect we just live with. 3. Chemical Control - Usually two or three sprays are directed at the plum curculio. Clean up fallen fruit in which eggs or larvae may be developing. There is an array of insecticides available for control of the plum curculio, but their performance characteristics vary greatly compared to our traditional broad-spectrum chemistries. Without this curved slit, eggs are killed by pressure from the groâ¦ The most important period to monitor is between bloom and about two weeks following petal fall. It was initially believed that plum curculio had one generation per year (univoltine), although recent evidence from some mid-Atlantic states suggests that there may be populations of plum curculio with more than one generation per growing season (multivoltine). The plum curculio is an important early season pest on pome and stone fruits. Plum curculio, Conotrachelus nenuphar, is a major pest of pome and stone fruits in North America. During this time, they mate and begin laying eggs. 1999), and management frequently relies on insecticide-based management. They become active shortly before peaches bloom. They move from the overwintering sites in April-May to the host plants where males and females mate. Plum Curculio, Conotrachelus nenuphar Host: This species is primarily a pest of plums and peaches but also damages cherries.nectarines, and apricots. A new paper, âA Review of the Biology, Ecology, and Management of Plum Curculio (Coleoptera: Curculionidae),â synthesizes the knowledge of this insect into a single review, allowing interested readers to learn the basics about the biology, life history, behavior, and management of the plum curculio in a single piece.

Sprays targeting the overwintered plum curculio generation also provide control of oriental fruit moth and suppress stinkbugs moving into orchards. These adults emerge from their overwintering sites to feed on trees in early spring. Soft fleshed fruits are preferred because the hard, developing fruit of apples and pears will actually crush the tiny plum curculio worm. The plum curculio (Conotrachelus nenuphar) is the most serious insect pest of apples and among the most destructive insect pests of peaches.

Plum curculio is one of the most serious pests of peach trees; they lay eggs within the fruit and both adults and larvae feed on the fruit, causing brown rot of the fruit. If the apples do not fall to the ground, the eggs probably did not hatch or the grubs did not develop. In apples, optimal timing and order selection of insecticides for plum curculio management is based on matching the performance characteristics of each compound with plum curculio life cycle development (Figure 1) and tree phenology (Table 1). Most grubs work their way into the center of the fruit. The plum curculio, C. nenuphar, is native to North America and restricted to east of the Rocky Mountains.Although it feeds on several wild host plants and several species of cultivated pome and stone fruit, C. nenuphar has not extended its geographical range over the years.

Introduction: The plum curculio (PC) was described under the apple section, but injury and monitoring are somewhat different with blueberry. Neglecting control can result in an 85% loss of fruit in apples from both feeding and oviposition scars as well as early fruit abortion or âdropâ due to larval feeding (Vincent and Roy 1992, Vincent et al. Full-grown larvae are 1/3 inch (7.5mm) long, legless, and white with brown heads. Females deposit each egg in a hole under a crescent-shaped cut eaten in the fruit. Stop! NAP.

The plum curculio, Conotrachelus nenuphar Herbst (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is an important pest of pome and stone fruit orchards in North America. Early spring in the Southeast, the female plum curculio begins depositing eggs singly in a hole that she creates in the fruit at shuck split in peaches. Adults overwinter in leaf litter and become active during spring. Fully grown larvae are about ¼ to 3/8 inch in length. Cultivate the soil surrounding infested trees in late spring or early summer to destroy pupating larvae that may have fallen to the ground with the fruit or pupae that may be developing in burrows in the ground. 7 Days) Laid singly inside fruit by female. Adults emerge in mid- to latesummer to cause more feeding damage on mature fruit before they overwinter.
