It can be either horizontal or vertical, but this is based on the axis of symmetry.      5 Find the vertex and axis of symmetry of the parabola?       When the parabola is vertical, the line of symmetry is vertical.              2 Or to put it another way, if you were to fold the parabola in half right down the middle, the vertex would be the "peak" of the parabola, right where it crossed the fold of paper.        Explore the relationship between the axis of symmetry and graph of a parabola by changing the values of a, b and c of the parabola plotter below, What is the following  parabola's axis of symmetry of $$ y = (x + 3)^2 + 4$$, Since this equation is in vertex form,use the formula $$ x = h $$.
