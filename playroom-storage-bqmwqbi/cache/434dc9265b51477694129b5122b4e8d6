Coogan Accounts are required for adherence to the Jackie Coogan Law, a law protecting child actors from financial harm at the hands of their parents, legal guardians, or employers. That can be tricky." Child actor labor laws allow a seventeen-year-old to work between six and eight hours on set, but they also prohibit a six-month-old from working more than twenty minutes under any circumstances. Child actors -- including all minors under the age of 18 -- are in a unique field that provides many opportunities, which can be financially rewarding. And, even on Broadway, for a performer who's under 16, the show is required to hire a supervisor for the child to be at the theatre at every performance. Once youâve wrapped principal photography, the hard partâs over. Next, youâll need to apply on behalf of the production for a permit to employ minors. Second, keep in mind that youâre not just casting a kidâyouâre also casting their parents. But Broadway work for young actors comes with a hefty share of challenges and concerns — both for the production itself, and for the families of these young triple-threats.
