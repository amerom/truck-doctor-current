One complaint is that the queen bed in the master bedroom is old and it should be replaced ASAP. We anticipate campgrounds will remain closed for a perior of at least three weeks. Watching anything on these was painful. We had a wonderful time at this home! Because you may only get one vacation a year, I will help you easily explore your options so you can be.

The pool table and the large seating area was very good to accommodate everyone. Feel free to rent kayaks, swim, or fish in these scenic California lakes! There was no TV in the master bedroom. As soon as I checked into the place, I found imperfections (back of couch torn, pool stick rack broke on one side, pool table stained) and reported them to VACASA and they were nice about it and noted what I found. Lots of things to do nearby. House was nice,  especially that the table had 8 seats and an extra 4 stools at breakfast bar. How can you choose the best quality vacation rental for your family?
