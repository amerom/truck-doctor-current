The 37 mm gun (1.46 in), M4, used the same high-explosive (M54) and practice (M55A1) projectiles as the 37 mm (1.46 in) antiaircraft gun, M1A2, but different cartridge cases were necessary due to the larger chamber of the M4 gun. I propose that you've spent too much time reading the statistics and too little time reading actual history. It was used on PT boats around 1944 in the Pacific theater during World War II, replacing the Handgrips of several configurations were used, with various sighting systems being tried out. 	 My previous posts explain what I believe drove Bell to that choice: Big gun for attacking Big planes, small guns for attacking small planes. The objective is a (possibly operational) 1/20th scale 37mm Canon.   M15 half-track. Due to the unprecedented amount of orders, the procurement on all the components and the manufacturing time necessary to â¦ 102-103. When they proved successful as anti-barge weapons, they were used in this role for the rest of the war.  The cannon was disliked by pilots for its drooping trajectory. 	 Side and top view with magazine . The Russians pilots would dive to very high speed on German formations, and make a single pass and egress [boom and Zoom]. --Nukes4Tots (talk) 16:33, 1 June 2009 (UTC). Incorrect. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 136.2.1.104 (talk) 19:25, 13 October 2010 (UTC), --Vsolferi (talk) 19:27, 13 October 2010 (UTC), (note: Moved from my talk page. It was also equipped with four .30 caliber, and two .50 caliber machine guns, which were no doubt for use against smaller, faster, maneuvering aircraft. --136.1.1.104 (talk) 19:05, 5 August 2011 (UTC). The White Motor Company produced a prototype halftrack using their own chassis and the body of the M3 Scout Car. The Browning prototype was built and demonstarted in 1921 and developed into an acceptable weapon by 1928.  It tended to jam under high gee forces. The "M9" was a related half-track armored car design. Russian air to air tactics were very poor at the outset of the war. Whether the M4 was an effective weapon, from an historical perspective,  may have more to do with the mix of enemy aircraft the cannon came up against than anything else. (and while I'm not sure this loading was used exclusively, it at least appears to point to there being a genuine 33 round capacity; I'd expect come loadings included 33 rounds of HE/T ammunition as that shell appears to be the most commonly used on aircraft mounted examples the weapon in general and made every single round useful as a tracer, which really makes sense given the slow rate of fire and genuine need to track the trajectory of individual shots), That article also cites the quotation made by Chuck Yeager where the weapon's trajectory was likened to "throwing a grapefruit". I'm going to move it to the M4 page and suggest you find some strong references to back up your strong assertions on the effectiveness of the M4. Prototype only. Gun Characteristics. Sold Surplus in 1946 for $1,250 it was used for aerial mapping until 1967 when it went on display at Harrah Automobile Collection where it remained on display unitl 1982.   Being that the T9 and M4 are different versions of the same gun, I think a merge is in order. 	213 lb (97 kg) The major function of the lock frame assembly was to force the cartridge into the chamber, actuate the breech block, fire the round by means of the hammer striking the firing pin, extract the cartridge case from the chamber, and operate the ejector. 	Colt The 37 mm autocannon had its root in 1921, designed by famed American firearms designer John M. Browning. The threat of large numbers of heavy bomber formations, that the cannon was employed on Airacobras to combat, was something that the allies never really had to face in the war. I'm removing it and moving it to the M3 article.--Nukes4Tots (talk) 00:43, 24 February 2009 (UTC), Okay, not entirely sure why, but the history of this autocannon is missing. — Preceding unsigned comment added by Kool kitty89 (talk • contribs) 23:47, 7 June 2016 (UTC), Why is there no mention of the weapon's use in the YFM-1 Airacuda? --136.2.1.104 (talk) 15:38, 18 October 2010 (UTC), "Satisfying the specification to the letter" is a bit of a missrepresentation of the process. After evaluation of the aircraft prototype, The Army liked the idea of the Cannon and so the specifications of the contract included the 37mm Cannon. 		Caliber It had a 74-inch barrel, weighed 405 pounds (the barrel alone weighing 120 pounds), had a muzzle velocity of 3,000 feet per second, and had a rate of fire of 150 rounds per minute. In fact, the 4x4 timber was used as a float by Kennedy and crew to keep them together during their swim ashore from the stricken hull, since they had displaced their life raft to make room for the 37mm cannon." If the trigger was held in the firing position, the gun would continue to fire automatically until the magazine was empty. The 15 rounds were in three five-round clips, an unsatisfactory arrangement according to Kelsey, and the M9 did not perform reliably in flight. 	 Vsolferi (talk) 18:58, 10 August 2010 (UTC), It is not at all clear what mistaken beliefs you think the first two paragraphs are based on. The 37 mm M9 autocannon was a derivative of the M1A2 anti-aircraft gun. It is also clear that fighters and Bombers were attacked in this manner. In "Attack of the Airacobras" [Dmitriy Loza], a cronicles of the use of the Bell P-39 and P-63 by the soviet air force against the Germans, are numerous statements of love for the 37mm cannon and it's ability to "wreck a plane with a single shot". 	 The experimental XP-58 Chain Lightning, a larger, more heavily armed version of the P-38 Lightning, was originally equipped with four M4s in its nose. 	 		Designer(s) The 37 mm Automatic Gun, M4, known as the T9 during development, was a 37 mm (1.46 in) recoil operated autocannon designed by Browning Arms Company.  This is of particular relevance to multiple claims present here: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=M4_cannon&oldid=693185660  One of the most fearsome was the "Quad-50" anti-aircraft platform which saw a battery of 4 x 0.50 (12.7mm) caliber Browning heavy machine guns mounted atop a turning pedestal. It had a 74-inch barrel, weighed 405 pounds (the barrel alone weighing 120 pounds), had a muzzle velocity of 3,000 feet per second, and had a rate of fire of 150 rounds per minute. 		Action Gun Wiki is a FANDOM Lifestyle Community. 37mm Cannon. The term "interceptor" was used to describe the roll of climbing to intercept a bomber and knock it out of the sky before it could drop it's bombs.    Top of the bullet ( fuse ) has â G15216 and picture of the anchor. In the mid-1930s, the United States Army had yet to field a dedicated anti-tank artillery piece; anti-tank companies of infantry regiments were armed with .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns. 		Country of origin â¢ The 37 mm M9 autocannon was a derivative of the M1A2 anti-aircraft gun. Soviet pilots, though off-put by the M4's slow cyclic rate and the low magazine capacity, had appreciated its reliability. For the TAP 120/Lvakan 4501 (120 mm autocannon), that's a watercooled barrel.  You extrapolate that since the P-39 proved ineffective against the Zero, it must be the autocannon's fault. You are correct that at the time there seemed to be much debate about the requirements for a fighter/persuit/intercepter aircraft, and Bell was trying to cover all bases. According to Birch Matthews book on the development of the P-39 and P-63 [Cobra! The type of round as, forexample, 13 x 64B. I think we have reached the point of agreement that while the Army's general specification asked for a cannon, it didn't specify the 37mm cannon. 	 However, it should at least be noted that the M4 cannon was more reliable than the American M1 and M2 Hispano cannons. 	 The use of the American Airacobras changed almost everything about the way the Russians fought the air war against the Germans. In World War II, the U.S. supplied the Soviet Air Forces with M4-equipped P-39 and P-63 planes on lend-lease with 1,232,991 rounds of M54 ammunition. M9 - International Harvester built half-track, developed to complement the M2 for Lend-Lease, but did not feature the short hull of the M2. --Nukes4Tots (talk) 16:35, 1 June 2009 (UTC) ), You can't reasonably compare machine guns with autocannons in a side-by-side review... the two will NOT compare favorably, regardless of what standard of comparison you are using. For whatever reason later P-39 (and P-63) variants didn't employ the M2 Hipano and don't even appear to have tested it experimentally. By absorbing the energy of the lock frame, the back plate assembly reduced the shock against the carrier pin as the lock frame was hatched to the rear. However, smaller autocannons were very often used in dogfighting, notably by the Japanese Mitsubishi Zero which had two 20mm cannon, one per wing, and two or four MGs. It was thought that a cannon was needed to have the fire power to down a large heavy bomber. 	 As the gun was originally designed, ammunition could be fed by a 5-round clip, a 15-round link belt, or an M6 non-disintegrating 30-round magazine, which was used exclusively in production. 		Feed system 	 The M4 was later replaced by the more powerful 37mm M9 autocannon. But again formations of 'Bettys' or Ju-88s, or Me-110s, on straight bombing runs the M4 would have been performing the role it was designed for. 1, United States, Senate. The first number is the caliber, in millimeter. 	 (The charachters on both the shell and fuse are read left to right while the shell is pointed away from you). It was used in the Bell P-39 Airacobra and P-63 Kingcobra. The breech was locked and unlocked by recoil action, which brings the operating level guide pins against cams to raise and lower the breechblock. Initial extraction occurred during recoil. 	Autocannon Between the world wars, the US Army sought to improve the tactical mobility of its forces. The trajectory was a mismatch for the high velocity weapons it was mated with on the P-39, but this is also true of the MG FF and MK 108 combined with cannons and/or machine guns of higher velocity as was common in German service, as well as various combinations of cannons used by the Japanese. Primarily used for air-to-air combat on the Eastern Front, the M4 was sometimes used against soft ground targets. The weapon, which was built by Colt, entered service in 1942. The non-recoiling parts included the trunnion block group, the feed box and feeding mechanism, the recuperator cylinder and bushing, the back plate group, and the manual charger assembly. For comparison of other larger than 20 mm caliber autocannons, the 23 mm Madsen cannon the US showed some pre-war interest in was belt-fed and capable of a 360 RPM cyclic rate with a typical muzzle velocity of 720 m/s while weighing 53 kg. 	65 in (1.651 m) With the goal of finding a high-mobility infantry vehicle, the Ordnance Department had evaluated the half-track design by testing French Citroën-Kégresse vehicles. The army didn't issue a pre-specification for someone to design a fighter with a 37mm cannon in it. 37 mm Automatic Gun, M4, Bell P-39 Airacobra, at National Museum of the United States Air Force (formerly the United States Air Force Museum). 	Technical specifications 	 The P-39 (or P-400) only used the Hispano briefly and I believe only in its drum-fed M1 form with a 60 round magazine capacity. --Vsolferi (talk) 15:39, 22 July 2011 (UTC)-vsolferi  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 136.1.1.105 (talk) 15:36, 22 July 2011 (UTC), The jamming issue is one that is tough to quantify, but it was a factor in the gun's reputation, true. M9A1 - The M2A1, an M9 with the M49 machine gun mount. It was used on PT boats around 1944 in the Pacific theater during World War II, replacing the Browning and the Colt Firearms Co reworked it into the T9/M4. Primary targets were landing barges used by enemy forces to move supplies down the island chain at night. 	 The 37 mm (1.46 in) M4 Automatic Cannon was a compact, low velocity and rate-of-fire auto-cannon developed by Browning in 1921. Ammunition was issued in the form of fixed rounds, consisting of: H.E.T. It was magazine-fed and could be fired either manually or by remote control using a solenoid mounted on the rear of thâ¦ Front view with magazine views . The 37 mm cannon were mounted onto the P-39 and P-63 series of fighters, but proved unpopular with the pilots. I think one can conclude that large caliber auto-cannons like the M4 were effective against large, non-maneuvering planes like bombers, but were not well suited for air to air combat involving agressively maneuvering targets such as other fighter aircraft. Please check your local laws before ordering. From such close distances, rate of fire, and trajectory were not a problem. But the bottom line really is that the US should have been capable of engineering a weapon using similar projectiles with better all around performance relative to weight/bulk (higher velocity and/or rate of fire for the same weight), or simply using smaller caliber projectiles as was really more desirable and indeed was the US Army's aim with their .90 caliber (23 mm) cannon projects. The P-39 was designed with the M4 for that purpose. It is normally loaded with M54 high-explosive tracer shells, but the weapon is also usable with M80 armor-piercing shells that could penetrate through an inch of armor plate at a distance of 500 yards. --136.2.1.104 (talk) 16:14, 20 December 2010 (UTC) .  Anti-aircraft autocannon developed in the United States. 	 You are incorrect in stating that Wildcats could "cut Zeros out of the sky". 		Weight Later, an improved pedestal mount was designed for original equipment mountings on the boats. The M9A1 had a rear door. The U.S. was developing heavy long range bombers like the B-17.  The 37 mm Automatic Gun, M4, known as the T9 during development, was a 37 mm (1.46 in) auto cannon designed by John Browning and used in the Bell P-39 Airacobra and P-63 Kingcobra fighters, as well as experimentally on other designs. 	Production information As a results new tactics evolved quickly in cobra equipped air wings. 	 I have a related question concerning the 37 mm semi-automatic M1924 gun; this was allegedly fitted to the T1E4 version of the experimental US T1 Cunningham tank of the 1920s. Bofors 40 mm gun. 		Type Email us for a quote: questmasters@hotmail.com Lot numbers can be changed to match whatever you would like. M4s were initially mounted on a simple pedestal mount (often built at the front lines) with the standard M6 magazine being used. In a filmed interview, Air Force pilot Chuck Yeager likened â¦ History: P-38L s/n 44-53186 was manufactured by Lockheed at their Burbank, California facility in 1945. It entered military service in 1942, used in the Bell P-39 Airacobra and P-63 Kingcobra aircraft. It was magazine-fed and could be fired either manually or by remote control using a solenoid mounted on the rear of the weapon. In "Attack of the Airacobras" by dimitri Loza The myth of the m4 auto cannon in the P-39 as a tank buster is dispelled on the first page.  Designation: 37 mm/56 M4: Ship Class Used On: PT Boats: Date Of Design: about 1937: Date In Service : 1942 (on PT Boats) Gun Weight: Without breech: 55 lbs. Also I am not incorrect in stating the 37 would also [meaning "secondarily"] be used in the ground attack role. There were aircraft that used 37mm anti-tank guns in WWII; such as the Junkers Ju-87 Stuka G1 and G-2 and the Yak-9T.  Regardless of the reason, it could not be used reliably in US service without a re-cocking mechanism accessible to the pilot (as the P-38 used) or excessive amounts of grease and wax applied to the ammunition (apparently causing a snug enough fit for a reliable primer strike) as the US Navy used. 	150 rpm  165 rpm (M10 cannon) The Russian pilots loved the M4 because it provided the fire power to kill an aircraft on one firing pass. It provided interceptors with a weapon that could shoot down any bomber with as little as one hit. [Source] • [Talk]  Olds also built the M7 3 inch cannon used in the M10 tank â¦ The fledgeling Bell aircraft company was trying to hedge it's bets and cover the fighter/persuit/interceptor roles with a single aircraft. 2 twin 0.50 cal Browning M2 Machine Guns: belt fed, 550 rpm, muzzle velocity of 2930 fps, max effective range 2500 yds, max range 4.2 miles, air cooled, recoil operated, gun length 61.5 inches, 24 inch barrel, gun weight 84 pounds, 710 gr. Because pilots weren't used to the weapon's drooping arc of fire, the quadruple M4s were replaced by a single 75mm M5 cannon with two .50 caliber heavy machine guns.  M4 27mm auto cannon on P-63 Kingcobra.com, https://guns.fandom.com/wiki/M4_cannon?oldid=83636. Prior to the Airacobra, many Russians planes were not even equipped with radios ["Attack of the Airacobras" (Dmitriy Loza) page reference needed]. It was this combination of factors that made it mediocre, as avoiding any one of those problems (let alone multiple ones) would have given it a good deal more overall merit. In this role a plane is best armed with multiple weapons of high fire rate to give the pilot a greater statistical chance of scoring hits on a small, fast, maneuvering aircraft.  as well as for much of the article's life prior to that date, but were removed in the update made here: 08:55, 1 December 2015‎ BilCat, This includes the claims of the 30 round endless loop belt actually being 33 rounds in capacity, arranged in 3 groups of 10 HE or AP ammunition with a tracer round at the end of each. In fact, the Zero was superior to EVERY prewar American fighter and most early war fighters. The 15 rounds were in three five-round clips, an unsatisfactory arrangement according to Kelsey, and the M9 did not perform reliably in flight. The Zero was excellent as a twisting, turning fighter. The recoil mechanism of the gun is comprised of the tube and tube extension, recuperator piston and piston rod, lock frame assembly, driving spring assemblies, and the breechblock assembly.  I added some amplifying information about usage of the 37mm cannon on board PT Boats and JFK using an M3 AT gun on his boat. These had issues with the chamber size and firing pin length being mismatched with the ammunition on top of apparently lax manufacturing tolerances (and refusal to copy British modifications of the weapon). 	 	 Initially, they were taken out of crashed P-39 aircraft at Henderson Field. 	 Little is known about this gun's deployment; the only confirmed use is in the US Navy PT boats mentioned above. M4 cannon It was Bell who chose the 37mm cannon to arm his planes with. The disscussion of the cannons of other calibers is a bit of a tangent, but I'll comment on it: The effectiveness of those weapons is not in question, as they were very effective in the air-to-air role, but they do not offer insight or provide evidence for the effectiveness of the 37mm in Air-to-air combat. Many of our customers also get into reloading to expand the use of their launcher.  The driving spring assemblies held the lock frame against the carrier dog until the carrier was released by carrier catch, which was pivoted by an incoming round. Unless otherwise noted, the data below is for the M4. The first early half tracks had been pioneered by Adolphe Kégresse in 1910, when at the service of the Tsar Imperial Garage. The lock frame was retracted by recoil action during automatic firing, and is forced forward by the driving springs. Weapons similar to or like 37 mm Gun M1.  	Recoil-operated Later in the war the more powerful 37 mm M9 was developed. The cannon is misunderstood and often misrepresented. Most PT boat gunners used tracer rounds to sight the fall of their shots. The M4 was later replaced by the more powerful 37mm M9 autocannon. Take your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat. Ammunition. The design, using as many commercial components as possible to improve reliability and rate of production, was standardized in 1940 and builâ¦ 	 Initial loading and cocking of the weapon was done manually. Thisshould be an obvious fact, but alas there is a lot ofmisinformation around. The M3 was then spawned into a myriad of roles from the base personnel carrier. I'm not too wikipedia savvy but if someone wants to find additional sources, there seem to be some experimental aircraft uses for the M9.  	  	John Browning  The Soviets did not use the P-39 for tank-busting, as the U.S. did not supply M80 rounds with the planes.  Most encounters were typically of the ambush type, where firing the weapons was held until very close range. Equipped with one M1 automatic 37 millimeter gun and two water-cooled .50 caliber (12.7 mm) M2 Browning heavy machine guns.  Actually this is incorrectly based on a Mk4 Cannon which is shorter than the Mk9 and has a different shape magazine . 		Rate of fire (less than most war-time variants of the Hispano and slightly more than half that of the M4) See: http://s120.photobucket.com/user/aoe276/media/23Madsen.jpg.html  The trajectory drooped harshly over distance and in night time opeâ¦ 		Manufacturer(s) The US Army bought several Citröen-Kégresse vehicles for evaluation in the late twenties, and developed their own sâ¦ Common practice for the Russians was to re-wire P-39 to fire the cannon and machineguns simultaniously, from a single trigger, and to hold fire until "the entire plane filled the windscreen". Disregarding the off-topic discussions comparing various other aircraft or (especially the actual operational use, rather than objective technical merit), the T9/M4 cannon had the for primary limitations in performance as an aircraft weapon: it was heavy, slow firing, relatively low velocity, and had a limited ammunition capacity. In the YP-38s, a 37mm (1.46in) M9 autocannon with 15 rounds replaced the T1. 140-160 RPM was very low for an aircraft autocannon to be practically used in any caliber and really made the weapon more realistically used as semi-automatic (which also better matched to its limited ammunition supply) but this was neither ideal nor standard procedure. The springs then drove the lock frame assembly forward to operate the ejector, chamber the round, and raise the breech block. In fact Armor peircing ammunition was part of the plane's weapon load-out options [Except for Russian Airacobras]. The M4 is fed ammunition only from the left-hand side of the weapon. In particular, the experimental P-63D-1 (production: 1) seems to have used an M9, and this one Russian webpage <http://www.airwar.ru/weapon/guns/m9.html> shows an A-20 and XA-41 as well. It is clear that the tactics developed by Russian pilots suited the effectiveness of the M4 as an air to air weapon. The logic you present, that heavy weapons were not allowed on fighters because Bombers were self defending, makes no sense because the heavy weapons were not deployed to protect bombers, they were employed to shoot them down. 		Production began 37mm Oldsmobile M9 autocannon: 30 rd magazine, 125rpm, muzzle velocity 2000 fps, range 8875 yds.  All of this is missing. Binksternet (talk) 16:20, 2 June 2009 (UTC). The 37 mm M9 autocannonwas a derivative of the M1A2 anti-aircraft gun. --Nukes4Tots (talk) 00:43, 24 February 2009 (UTC), I was wondering if the M4 was ever used by P-39 and P-63 pilots to try and destroy tanks, especially the Russians on the Eastern Front? It is worth noting that description of Russian encounters with German aircraft follow the paradigm of the use for the M4 as a weapon for use against non-maneuvering targets. This cannon was installed only days before the mission where PT-109 was lost.  Loza explains that there has been a mis-interpretation of the term "ground support" from the Russian definition [which means stopping enemy aircraft from attacking Russian Ground troups] to the allied definition of "ground Attack" [Where Russian aircraft would attack troops on the ground].  Shortly thereafter it was purchased by its current ownâ¦ Wikipedia.  	United States of America The function of the breechblock was to help in the final chambering of the round, close the breech, and actuate the trigger trip. The Russian pilots appreciated the Cobra's 'devastating' firepower which enabled them to destroy the target bandit in a single pass. P-40's could do that as well. Recoil and counter-recoil were controlled hydraulically via a piston and spring combination connected to the recoil mechanism and operating in an oil-filled recuperator cylinder that is mounted to the stationary trunnion block assembly. 		Used by 		Barrel length You can't blame that on the armament, it was maneuverability, handling, and speed. there is however no evidence it was ever used as an effective tank buster.
