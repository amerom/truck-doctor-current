But that potential is wasted in the Fox News drama Bombshell, which chooses to follow the much simpler (and more flattering) ... played by Nicole Kidman, at face value.                      17 January 2020 by DM Bradley. Bombshell is a revealing look inside the most powerful and controversial media empire of all time; and the explosive story of the women who brought down the infamous man who created it.                         | Rating: 2/5 Hi, I’m Jay Roach. The film is about selling sex, selling a candidate, selling yourself, selling the truth. Denver and Delilah Productions,  “Bombshell” depicts, with equal parts bemusement and outrage, the explosion that occurred when the women of Fox News Channel dared to expose the culture of sexual harassment that had prevailed for so long at the cable television juggernaut. Incredibly provocative and controversial, Bombshell is a compelling issue drama. Photo: Studio Canal Film review: Bombshell Film . The ever-magnetic Robbie gets a dramatic arc to play, going from wide-eyed true believer (“I see myself as an influencer in the Jesus space,” she says with total sincerity while pitching herself for a position) to disillusioned whistle-blower. ‘Bombshell’ movie review: The claustrophobia of workplace toxicity Kennith Rosario January 03, 2020 15:01 IST Updated: January 03, 2020 15:48 … “Bombshell” is a scalding and powerful movie about what selling, in America, has become. Kelly shares in conspiratorial tones who the players are, how the power structure operates and what people must do to survive—especially if they want those coveted spots on air. Some of the performances are startlingly dead-on, like Alanna Ubach’s Jeanine Pirro and Allison Janney’s Susan Estrich. And the film has a strong cast that includes Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman, Margot Robbie, and John Lithgow.                      Read full article. While this story deserved some kind of film, I don't believe an adapted narrative was the right decision.                         |, December 7, 2020                      Rachael Mead. Bombshell is a scalding and powerful movie about what selling, in America, has become. Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) is consulting lawyers for a personal harassment lawsuit against Ailes the person, not Fox News, but she needs other women to come forward. Don’t worry, it won’t take long.                          Still, it's an engaging and evocative story about an important social issue.                                                                 We won’t be able to verify your ticket today, but it’s great to know for the future.                         Annapurna Pictures,  A formidable cast brings the downfall of former Fox News head Roger Ailes to the big screen in an often-disturbing study of the network’s top-down culture of sexual harassment and misogyny. Click here to read the full article. Roach includes actual footage—and sometimes seamlessly inserts his actors into the images—but he also employs hand-held camerawork and snap-zooms as if he were directing an episode of “The Office,” and the approach feels inconsistent and a little jarring. Bombshell is well-intentioned but uncomfortable viewing at times, as it should be.                         Metropolitan FilmExport,  Bombshell is a fast-paced, riveting, and timely portrayal of a landmark moment in media history and is anchored by three flawless performances …                      Bombshell’s hypocrisy recalls that quip about a neon sign spelling out the soullessness of neon. Transforming her voice into a husky boom, Charlize Theron (‘Mad Max: Fury Road’) continues to be the best thing in movies about irresponsible men. It’s a miracle of makeup design, sure—the cheekbones and the turned-up nose, with eyeliner and thick, fake lashes doing much of the heavy lifting to complete the look. 69% TOMATOMETER January 29, 2020 September 22, 2020 8 min read Engelbert Rafferty. Rotten Tomatoes Predicts the 2020 Oscar Winners: Our Final Picks for the 92nd Academy Awards!                         | Rating: 3/5 Bombshell benefits from a terrific cast and a worthy subject, but its impact is muffled by a frustrating inability to go deeper than the sensationalistic surface. The other two main characters wrestle with how far to go in a corporate culture of keeping secrets from very powerful, very dirty old men.                      (This is a great, showy role for Lithgow, giving him plenty of room to show his range as he portrays the profane, predatory and paranoid sides of the portly executive’s personality.)

Your Ticket Confirmation # is located under the header in your email that reads "Your Ticket Reservation Details". Bombshell is an incredibly well-acted exposé, delivered in a way that makes its abhorrent topic easy to watch, a process which does slightly undercut the film's overall impact Bombshell is well-intentioned but uncomfortable viewing at times, as it should be. She also gets the most deeply uncomfortable scene in the film, as we see Kayla endure an agonizing meeting with Ailes in which he asks her to stand and hike up her black dress higher and higher.                      Just leave us a message here and we will work on getting you verified. Granted, "Bombshell" might have been better served by a premium-TV showcase as well, since the behind-the-curtain peek at media and politics has all the trappings of an HBO movie. And as other high-profile women come forward with vocal support of Ailes, Kelly’s silence becomes even more conspicuous. While the film purports to be about the Roger Ailes scandal of 2016, it just uses that as a pretext to tell a sexual harassment drama (and to take some knocks at FOX News). [Makeup artist Kazuhiro Tsuji] is the real star of the show. Margot Robbie shines in the role of Kayla, a rare character who’s not based on an actual person but rather a composite of various network employees who suffered through Ailes’ lewd advances. Bombshell arrives in the UK just as Harvey Weinstein is being taken to court by his accusers, with the real world lining up with the award season push.
