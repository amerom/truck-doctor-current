These energetic electrons and protons initially move past Earth for several thousands of miles before traveling back along Earth’s magnetic field lines into Earth’s atmosphere. This photo is about sky, stars, surreal As the evening progresses, the aurora brightens and develops vertical rays caused by electrical currents that flow down the magnetic field lines. Northern Lights. Other colors may be seen as a mixture, or blending, of the three. Thanks to digital photography, they also capture images from space that offer views and observational data of the aurora never before seen. It was almost a surreal experience that something that beautiful was real. It is an 11-year cycle (or half of a 22-year cycle) because sunspots appear in pairs with a signature of magnetically “north” or magnetically “south.” At the end of 11 years, the spots switch their signature from “south” to “north” (or vice versa) and begin a new solar cycle.The 11-year sun cycle is not always exact and throughout history, it has seen periods of significant variation.”, Aurora borealis over Mount Sukakpak, Brooks Range, Alaska.
