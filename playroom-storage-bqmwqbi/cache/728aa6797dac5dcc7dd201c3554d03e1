The colour shows how important each action is considered to be for the conservation of this species. They are found in tropical Asia and Africa and are 30 to 90 cm (1 to 3 feet) long exclusive of the tail. [34], Arboreal pangolins live in hollow trees, whereas the ground-dwelling species dig tunnels to a depth of 3.5 m (11 ft 6 in). The Chinese pangolin inhabits higher, colder elevations than most other pangolins and seems to be the only species of pangolin that “hibernates” (though it is not a true hibernation, more of an “overwintering”). [34], Pangolins are insectivorous. [37] Pangolins are an important regulator of termite populations in their natural habitats.[38]. We combined all of the expert information on conservation actions to calculate an overall conservation attention score for this species. Thanks to the unfortunate belief that pangolin flesh, scales, and fetuses are delicacies and/or have medicinal benefits, the Chinese Pangolin and the Sunda Pangolin are classified as Endangered.

The genus name Manis come from the Latin word for “ghost” or “underworld,” which may refer to their solitary, nocturnal habits. [50][51][52][53][54] 100,000 are estimated to be trafficked a year to China and Vietnam,[55] amounting to over one million over the past decade. A number of extinct  pangolin species are also known. Without teeth, pangolins also lack the ability to chew;[41] however, while foraging, they ingest small stones (gastroliths) which accumulate in their stomachs to help to grind up ants. For each action, we asked experts for each species to assess the extent to which that action is being carried out and how much of the species’ range that action occurs in. The experts also judged how important each category was to the conservation of that particular species. [31] They have short legs, with sharp claws which they use for burrowing into ant and termite mounds and for climbing. [80] While no scientific evidence exists for the efficacy of those practices, and they have no logical mechanism of action,[80][81][82][83][84] their popularity still drives the black market for animal body parts, despite concerns about toxicity, transmission of diseases from animals to humans, and species extermination. Available at: Prepare a distribution map of pangolin for Nepal and identify pangolin strongholds, National pangolin conservation action plan produced and endorsed, Study on habitat suitability for Chinese pangolin in Nepal, Education and outreach on importance of pangolin conservation at local and national level, Establish community based pangolin conservation areas (in strongholds), Establish community based anti-poaching units or pangolin conservation committees and mobilize them for conservation work in community based pangolin conservation areas, Train and equip local youths for pangolin monitoring in strongholds, Ensure action based pangolin conservation in strongholds, Develop national and international cooperation between scientific and expert organizations/individuals working on research and conservation of Chinese pangolin, Implement livelihood interventions in community based pangolin conservation strongholds, Develop a seizure database system of pangolins for Nepal, Develop pangolin price index at local, cluster and national level, Implement programs to minimize climate induced disasters in pangolin strongholds. [34], Some pangolins walk with their front claws bent under the foot pad, although they use the entire foot pad on their rear limbs. 208728. The demand for their hard scales in highest in Asia, where they are commonly used in traditional medicines. Pangolin scales, which account for 20% of the animal's weight, are used in parts of Asia for a wide array of unproven medicines. Seven species of pangolins are found across the world, of which, two are found in India, namely Indian pangolin and Chinese pangolin. [33] Large pangolins can extend their tongues as much as 40 cm (16 in), with a diameter of only 0.5 cm (1⁄4 in). The Chinese Pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) is a small Asian mammal featured in the Standard Edition of Planet Zoo.. Zoopedia Description General. Some species, such as the tree pangolin, use their strong, prehensile tails to hang from tree branches and strip away bark from the trunk, exposing insect nests inside.
