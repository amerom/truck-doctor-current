Externally exposed sensilla, amphids and phasmids, in the pine wood nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus were examined with respect to their number, wiring, and position in comparison with those reported in the free-living soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.When B. xylophilus was soaked in FITC solution at 5°C for a few hours, two pairs of amphid neurons were stained. are reproductive stages in nematodes. None of the above are correct. Subsequent work has dissected the behavioral function of individual amphid neurites and their associated neural networks in considerable detail (e.g., Perkins et al., 1986 ; Mori and Ohshima, 1995 ; Chang et al., 2006 ; Chalasani et al., 2008 ). Start studying Aphasmids and Phasmid Nematodes. Phasmids are well-developed, while amphids are poorly developed or absent in this group. Amphids are the principal olfactosensory organs of nematodes. Amphids (Greek: amphi, around, double) are innervated invaginations of cuticle in nematodes. The lateral caudal papillae connected with the lateral precaudal glands. -Amphids-Phasmids -Photoreceptors on body surface or ocelli-Mechanoreceptors - papillae (modified cilia) Phasmids. Phasmids are glandulo secretory porous sensory structures. All of the six inner labial, six outer labial, and four cephalic sense organs as well as the amphids have characteristics indicating chemosensitivity, but there are no clearly identifiable mechanosensitive units. posterior location in lateral field - (chemoreceptors). Nematodes incubated in this staining solution usually produced copious amounts of secretions from their amphids and excretory pore. are acquired by eating uncooked beef. References.
