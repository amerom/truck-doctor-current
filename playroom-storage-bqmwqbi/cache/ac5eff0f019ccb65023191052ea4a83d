On Yeezus, Kanye makes a statement saying that he IS better than everyone else, no questions asked. 3.7 great. Coming from the man who jumped on-stage and grabbed Taylor Swift's VMA award, or called the American President a racist during a nationally televised charity event, this angry, cathartic, and concise album (punkishly running 40 minutes), and its unconventional road to release seems like a personal quest for the next provocative, headline-making, and unforgettable fix. Among these was a collaborative project with Kid Cudi, titled KIDS SEE GHOSTS; along with his eighth studio album, ye, which tied Eminem and The Beatles for eight consecutive chart-topping releases. Every Kanye West album release is an event unto itself. 2013 Preview Editors' Notes “Yeezy season approaching”, warns Kanye West over the buzzsaw synth and jittery beats of “On Sight”. UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE UNABLE TO GIVE YOU ACCESS TO OUR SITE AT THIS TIME. The opening track “On Sight” isn’t the best song on the album but it has good production. Quite possibly West’s most surprising contribution to the music industry was his production streak during the summer of 2018, in which he produced five albums. Production for the album began in Paris at the "No Name Hotel", in which the album was produced in the living room of a loft space. This aggro-industrial earthquake with booming bass and minimal synths balances groundbreaking hip-hop lyrics ("New Slaves" is a bizarre, layered concept clash where high fashion, slavery, and "I'd rather be a dick than a swallower" all collide) with punkish, irresponsible blast-femy (during the draggy, trap track "I'm in It," West's melodious and melancholy voice shouts its dreams to the multitude, pleading "Your titties, let 'em out, free at last/Thank God almighty, they free at last" as if civil rights and booty calls were equally noble quests), and it all works in an astonishing, compelling manner. Each track has it's own unique style and I … Review by Channing Freeman STAFF June 18th, 2013 | 5625 replies. Yeezus is with Jesus. West's "Yeezus" album is due for a June 18 release and features songs like "I am God."

Unlike Dali 's separate delivery of the two, Yeezus is an extravagant stunt with the high-art … Kanye let’s out all of his views and opinions on the track, the beat is pretty dope too. "), which still outdoes its provocative title with a swelled-head manifesto plus an unexpected, Magic-Mike-meets-Aphex-Twin boom production courtesy of Daft Punk. Kanye went all out on Yeezus, and because of that it remains an instant classic. West’s first kid was born Saturday, and Yeezus — recorded mostly in three very recent weeks — was written and made during his daughter’s gestation. (MORE: The 8 Best Things Kanye West Told The New York Times) The guy’s on edge, see. The public’s love for Kanye West has been apparent from the get-go, and each of his solo albums, barring his 2004 debut, The College Dropout, has peaked at #1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Album Chart. Kanye West Yeezus. Kanye’s sixth solo album, Yeezus, polarized his fan base and the general public but was heaped with rave reviews by music critics. The ubiquitous Kanye West—from his famous quip, “George Bush doesn’t care about black people,” to “I'ma let you finish,” to marrying Kim Kardashian, to announcing that he’s running for President, and admitting his love for President Trump—you can see that he’s a staple of the tabloids and the entertainment world, industry-wide. The opening track “On Sight” isn’t the best song on the album but it has good production.

That's an unfathomable thing for most and irritating for many, but it's Kanye's unbelievable reality, so complaining about Yeezus being unrelatable is like complaining the sky is untouchable.

By the time he reaches the third track, “I Am a God”, it’s clear we’re dealing with a deity of the vengeful, gnashing-of-teeth variety. Yeezus is a Once again Kanye To The, Chi town god, delivers again.  For instance, his 2010 album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, was universally praised by fans and critics alike; it was recorded during the backlash he received from the Swift interruption and during his break-up with then-girlfriend Amber Rose.
