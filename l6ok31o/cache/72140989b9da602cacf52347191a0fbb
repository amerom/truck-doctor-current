Great Service from start to finish. Only by seeing the physical track can your builder ensure the structural opening and ground level works when the doors arrive. Alan knew exactly what we wanted and provided a sleek, affordable solution - much better than I anticipated. The whole service has been professional and the quality of fitting is top notch. Creating a flush threshold on sliding doors as well as effective drainage and weather protection has many benefits when planning a new extension.  That little split caught on the door and became a whole big mess. His 'trouble-shooting' colleague Martin attended yesterday. Our neighbours also used Open Living before us and had a few issues at installation, but we believe these were mainly due to a supplier issue. You need to know which products come with the option of a flush threshold. The fitters are all great guys, and they take time to do a good job.The service and the products supplied have been excellent. Involve your builder, architect and your door provider early on in your planning. He came highly recommended by Nick Dardalis  of Aluminium Trades Supply website. Recently, a small repair was needed and the  after service care, even after this time, was quick and responsive, which meant a lot.Great prompt, friendly service with a quality product. 5****. Alan and his team did and excellent job installing two very large windows that have completely transformed our dining room. Lovely people to do business with, we bought some BiFold doors and a window from OpenLiving. Thank you very much. Take a look at our portfolio of projects showing us working with buildersÂ at the critical build stage. Great customer service from start to finish. Once agreed upon we were visited by Colin who came along and measured up and offered some great ideas.Several weeks later the 2 fitters visited and installed the conservatory. This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. We did have a couple of minor teething issues once fitted but these were dealt with quickly and without fuss. In order to do this flush without a step down, you do have to put a drain in. Excellent service from start to finish. I will be ordering more windows and do not hesitate to recommend them. Itâs the same for timber doors, also rarely having the very flush threshold arrangement. Copyright Â© 2020 Open LivingÂ®. On the day of the window fitting the men were polite and courteous, made sure that there was no mess, and completed the job easily within the day. Some doors are lower than others, but you will have a VERY difficult time finding a sliding door with a "flush" threshold unless your existing floor is built up substantially. Now looking forward to the erection of the conservatory. Highly recommend Newlite and would definitely use again if needed. Windows look great and a friendly service from Allan and Martin. Trained and experienced installers who care about attention to detail, Local reputation with many satisfied customers. Your internal flooring meets the threshold on â¦ Excellent service. FREE DOOR PROFILE SAMPLES. All of their staff have been excellent from start to finish, from keeping us informed about unavoidable delays because of the Covid Lockdown, all of the installation work, and coming back to sort any little problems, such as changing a stiff patio door lock from a key to a thumb turn. Rather than steering us toward the most expensive option they were usually able to offer a choice on each aspect and the pricing was very transparent and competitive. We supply and fit aÂ flush threshold on sliding doors as well as our bifolding doors. Any rainwater hitting the surface of that glass wall will run down the face of the glazing, into the flush threshold aluminium frame and onto the neoprene block below and is then forced onto the outside, where you want it to go! In addition to creating seamless transition between living spaces, the inclusion of a flush threshold minimises the risk of trips and falls and ensures ease of accessibility. We weren't quite sure what bi-folding doors would be best but all the options were clearly and concisely laid out before us and some great solutions suggested to the issues we hadn't been able to work out on our own or with our builder. Had some OW80 windows that were fitted some time ago (by other installers, who had lost the cill caps).Marsha kindly helped me get some replacement items from Origin despite there being no financial incentive for open living to do so.Assistance has been very much appreciated and would highly recommend. Excellent communication, trustworthy and very reliable. Your doors must offer all the weather protection as well as effective drainage of water to the outside. Can highly recommend. Optional. This will mean you â¦ Condition: New. Gone are the hideous white plastic windows from the 90s, now we have the view in to our garden framed by two gorgeous black framed aluminium windows. Otherwise PVC with low aluminum threshold. All I can say is quality, absolute quality.Would have no hesitation recommending this company to others, would use them again tomorrow if I needed too. The inner and outer floor levels are flat and must prevent rainwater outside finding its way inside or crossing the flush threshold. Brilliant experience dealing with the Newlite team. We are very happy with our new windows and doors. The sliding part of the door always runs on the outside of the fixed light. His customer service is excellent. Tested to the requirements of Part M the thermally broken low threshold improves the overall thermal performance for the full perimeter of the door. Alan and his team, again impressed us with their commitment to excellence. Alan attended our home and spent time running through options and design. I'm so super happy with Alan, his team and most importantly the product. All of these work to seal the doors and push any water on the track effectively to the outside and away from the doors. So far I have ordered 12.5m sliding doors, 1 set of aluminium bi-folds and 5 windows from Open Living. I am astounded that the new window looks virtually the same as the original, well done! The best advice we can give is to talk to your door installer as early as possible as well as involving your builder. It looks brilliant.
