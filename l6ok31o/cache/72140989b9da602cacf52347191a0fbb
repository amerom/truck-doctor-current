This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. We did have a couple of minor teething issues once fitted but these were dealt with quickly and without fuss. In order to do this flush without a step down, you do have to put a drain in. Excellent service from start to finish. I will be ordering more windows and do not hesitate to recommend them.

On the day of the window fitting the men were polite and courteous, made sure that there was no mess, and completed the job easily within the day. Some doors are lower than others, but you will have a VERY difficult time finding a sliding door with a "flush" threshold unless your existing floor is built up substantially.

Any rainwater hitting the surface of that glass wall will run down the face of the glazing, into the flush threshold aluminium frame and onto the neoprene block below and is then forced onto the outside, where you want it to go! In addition to creating seamless transition between living spaces, the inclusion of a flush threshold minimises the risk of trips and falls and ensures ease of accessibility. We weren't quite sure what bi-folding doors would be best but all the options were clearly and concisely laid out before us and some great solutions suggested to the issues we hadn't been able to work out on our own or with our builder. Had some OW80 windows that were fitted some time ago (by other installers, who had lost the cill caps).Marsha kindly helped me get some replacement items from Origin despite there being no financial incentive for open living to do so.Assistance has been very much appreciated and would highly recommend.
