[228], In 1995, Ali led a group of Japanese and American professional wrestlers, including his 1976 opponent Antonio Inoki and Ric Flair, on a sports diplomacy mission to North Korea. But there is an irony to the fact that while the Nation branded white people as devils, Ali had more white colleagues than most African American people did at that time in America, and continued to have them throughout his career. The last four rounds saw round-to-round shifts in momentum between the two fighters. I done wrestled with an alligator, I done tussled with a whale; handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder in jail; only last week, I murdered a rock, injured a stone, hospitalized a brick; I'm so mean I make medicine sick. Omissions? [175] They asked fans worldwide to contribute a dollar each. [44] He then began to work with trainer Fred Stoner, whom he credits with giving him the "real training", eventually molding "my style, my stamina and my system." [244][245][246] Ali published an oral history, Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times by Thomas Hauser, in 1991. [74] In 1969 the boxers were filmed sparring for about 75 one-minute rounds; they produced several potential outcomes. He was a boxer and an activist, but he also had a role in influencing what now dominated pop-culture, hip-hop. Ali visited North Korea as a celebrity guest. After dodging a few punches, Monsoon put Ali in an airplane spin and dumped him to the mat. In the sixth, Clay dominated, hitting Liston repeatedly. For the last four years of Clay's amateur career he was trained by boxing cutman Chuck Bodak.[45]. He has been cited as an inspiration by rappers such as LL Cool J,[22] Public Enemy's Chuck D,[212] Jay-Z, Eminem, Sean Combs, Slick Rick, Nas and MC Lyte. [5][10] As a Muslim, Ali was initially affiliated with Elijah Muhammad's Nation of Islam (NOI). The most notable of these bouts occurred on October 1, 1975, when Ali and Joe Frazier met in the Philippines, 6 miles (9.5 km) outside Manila, to do battle for the third time. [161], In a 2004 autobiography, Ali attributed his conversion to mainstream Sunni Islam to Warith Deen Muhammad, who assumed leadership of the Nation of Islam upon the death of his father Elijah Muhammad, and persuaded the Nation's followers to become adherents of Sunni Islam. On March 6, 1964, he took the name Muhammad Ali, which was given to him by his spiritual mentor, Elijah Muhammad. The outcome of the fight was a major upset. "I want to torture him", he said. Clay had met Dundee in February 1957 during Clay's amateur career. Sonny Liston on the canvas while Cassius Clay (later Muhammad Ali) raises his arms in triumph after his first-round defeat of Liston in 1965. [233], In 1980, Ali was recruited by President Jimmy Carter for a diplomatic mission to Africa, in an effort to persuade a number of African governments to join the US-led boycott of the Moscow Olympics (in response to the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan). In 1978, he said "Women are not made to be hit in the breast, and face like that. Edited versions of the bout were shown in movie theaters in 1970. The punch used to knock Dunn out was taught to Ali by Taekwondo Grandmaster Jhoon Rhee. Other boxing commissions followed suit. [156], Aligning himself with the Nation of Islam, its leader Elijah Muhammad, and a narrative that labeled the white race as the perpetrator of genocide against African Americans made Ali a target of public condemnation. Based on Clay's uninspired performance against Jones and Cooper in his previous two fights, and Liston's destruction of former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson in two first-round knockouts, Clay was a 7–1 underdog. [207][208] It reached number 61 on the album chart and was nominated for a Grammy Award. [153], Not afraid to antagonize the white establishment, Ali stated, "I am America. Clay made his amateur boxing debut in 1954 against local amateur boxer Ronnie O'Keefe. It came at a time when most people in the United States still supported the war in Southeast Asia. "[176] The former Beatles were indifferent to the plan, which elicited only a tepid response from the public. His most-watched fights drew an estimated 1–2 billion viewers worldwide between 1974 and 1980, and were the world's most-watched live television broadcasts at the time. My arms, my face, my sides all ache. After that he fought Joe Frazier a second time and won a unanimous 12-round decision. [117], By the summer of 1977, his second marriage was over due to Ali's repeated infidelity and he had married actress and model Veronica Porché. [55] Around this time, Clay sought longtime idol Sugar Ray Robinson to be his manager, but was rebuffed.[56]. He had nine children, most of whom avoided the spotlight of which Ali was so fond. [269], Ali's funeral had been pre-planned by himself and others for several years prior to his actual death. [99][100], Following this win, on July 27, 1979, Ali announced his retirement from boxing. 70,000 people attended the bout and paid a total of $6 million admission, making it the largest live gate in boxing history at that time. Muhammad Ali Center(ルイビル)に行くならトリップアドバイザーで口コミ(1,237件）、写真（596枚）、地図をチェック！Muhammad Ali Centerはルイビルで17位(173件中)の観光名所です。 [48], Adding to the atmosphere were the considerable pre-fight theatrics and name calling. Dave Wolf, who worked in Frazier's camp, recalled that, "Ali was saying 'the only people rooting for Joe Frazier are white people in suits, Alabama sheriffs, and members of the Ku Klux Klan. "[192], Civil rights figures came to believe that Ali had an energizing effect on the freedom movement as a whole. Then, beginning in the second round, and to the consternation of his corner, Ali retreated to the ropes and invited Foreman to hit him while covering up, clinching and counter-punching, all while verbally taunting Foreman. Then he retired from boxing, but two years later he made an ill-advised comeback and suffered a horrible beating at the hands of Larry Holmes in a bout that was stopped after 11 rounds. Pacheco was quoted as saying, "the New York State Athletic Commission gave me a report that showed Ali's kidneys were falling apart. [51], In each of these fights, Clay vocally belittled his opponents and vaunted his abilities. Although Ali clearly had the better of Patterson, who appeared injured during the fight, the match lasted 12 rounds before being called on a technical knockout. Over the next 30 months, at the peak of his popularity as champion, Ali fought nine times in bouts that showed him to be a courageous fighter but a fighter on the decline. Proposed motivations include threats on his life from the Nation of Islam, that he had bet against himself and that he "took a dive" to pay off debts. [217], Ali appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated on 38 different occasions,[298] second only to Michael Jordan's 46. He lost the title by split decision. [115] In January 1985, Aaisha sued Ali for unpaid palimony. Ali was a member of the inaugural class of the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990, and in 2005 he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Ali then agreed to a third match with Joe Frazier in Manila. [149] Around that time Ali moved to the south side of Chicago and lived in a series of houses, always near the Nation of Islam's Mosque Maryam or Elijah Muhammad's residence. In the lead-up to the fight Frazier called Ali, "Clay", this angered Ali so he portrayed Frazier as a "dumb tool of the white establishment." Against the odds, and amidst pandemonium in the ring, Ali had regained the title by knockout. These statements of confidence unsettled his taller opponent, whom Los Angeles Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke had offered a record-setting contract, conditional on Chamberlain agreeing to abandon what Cooke termed "this boxing foolishness",[79] and he did exactly that. Liston was widely regarded as the most intimidating, powerful fighter of his era. I used to train to their music." Ali was strong in the early rounds of the fight, and staggered Frazier in the second round. She said he accepted responsibility and took care of her, but all contacts with him were cut off after he married his fourth wife Lonnie. The fight was stopped when Frazier's trainer, Eddie Futch, refused to allow Frazier to answer the bell for the 15th and final round, despite Frazier's protests. His conversion to Islam and draft evasion conviction surrounded him with controversy and even exile from boxing for three years. Born into a Chicago family that had converted to the Nation Of Islam, she later changed her name to Khalilah Ali, though she was still called Belinda by old friends and family. [58] Though unconfirmed, boxing historian Bert Sugar said that two of Liston's opponents also complained about their eyes "burning". [96], Ali fought Ken Norton for the third time in September 1976. [177] No reunion happened. Ali thrived in the spotlight at a time when many fighters let their managers do the talking, and he was often provocative and outlandish. "[72] The fight was close until the seventh round, when Ali bloodied Terrell and almost knocked him out. You might have seen the last of me. The Muhammad Ali effect, named after Ali, is a term that came into use in psychology in the 1980s, as he stated in The Greatest: My Own Story: "I only said I was the greatest, not the smartest. [229], Ali began visiting Africa, starting in 1964 when he visited Ghana. [282] In November 2005, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George W. Bush,[283][284] followed by the Otto Hahn Peace Medal in Gold of the UN Association of Germany (DGVN) in Berlin for his work with the civil rights movement and the United Nations, which he received on December 17, 2005. Boxing writer Richie Giachetti said, "Larry didn't want to fight Ali. However, both "died" within 10 days. [167][168][169][170] According to Ali's daughter, Hana Yasmeen Ali, who co-authored The Soul of a Butterfly with him, Ali was attracted to Sufism after reading the books of Inayat Khan, which contain Sufi teachings. Your hands can’t hit what your eyes can’t see. On March 6, 1964, Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad announced that Clay would henceforth be known as Muhammad Ali. During this part of the bout Ali did some effective counter-punching, but for the most part absorbed punishment from a relentlessly attacking Frazier. "[166], In later life after retiring from boxing, Ali became a student of the Quran and a devout Muslim. This led to a rematch with Joe Frazier at Madison Square Garden on January 28, 1974; Frazier had recently lost his title to George Foreman. "[158] In relation to integration, he said: "We who follow the teachings of Elijah Muhammad don't want to be forced to integrate. Tex Maule later wrote: "It was a wonderful demonstration of boxing skill and a barbarous display of cruelty." [147] Shortly afterwards on March 6, Elijah Muhammad gave a radio address that Clay would be renamed Muhammad (one who is worthy of praise) Ali (most high). [259] Ali's daughter May May Ali responded to the rumors, stating that she had talked to him on the phone the morning of February 3 and he was fine. Hauser wrote about the story, "The thought that Liz and Roz (the lesbian couple he met) were happy pleased Muhammad. According to Ali biographer Thomas Hauser, "at best, it was ill-conceived; at worst, a diplomatic disaster." "[194], In speaking of the cost on Ali's career of his refusal to be drafted, his trainer Angelo Dundee said, "One thing must be taken into account when talking about Ali: He was robbed of his best years, his prime years. [86] The fight was watched by a record estimated television audience of 1 billion viewers worldwide. After the fight he cited Frazier as "the greatest fighter of all times next to me. "[231] In 1978, following his loss to Spinks and before winning the rematch, Ali visited Bangladesh and received honorary citizenship there. Triumphs over Floyd Patterson, George Chuvalo, Henry Cooper, Brian London, and Karl Mildenberger followed. At the time, Spinks had only seven professional fights to his credit, and had recently fought a draw with journeyman Scott LeDoux. [299] He also appeared on the cover of Time Magazine 5 times,[300] the most of any athlete. However a few seconds later Walcott, having been informed by the timekeepers that Liston had been down for a count of 10, stopped the match and declared Ali the winner by knockout. "[181] Ali elaborated: "Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go ten thousand miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam while so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights? Chuck D, a rapper for the band Public Enemy is the host. [136] Both homes were subsequently sold after Ali's death with Lonnie living in their remaining home in Paradise Valley, Arizona. In addition, he was known for his social message of black pride and black resistance to white domination and for refusing induction into the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War. Clay infuriated devotees of the sport as much as he impressed them. By late 2005 it was reported that Ali’s condition was notably worsening. The fight was even in the early rounds, but Ali was taking more punishment than ever in his career. In late 1966, he also pledged to donate a total of $100,000 to the UNCF (specifically promising to donate much of the proceeds of his title defense against Cleveland Williams), and paid $4,500 per closed circuit installation at six HBCUs so they could watch his fights. [23] He also featured as an actor and writer, releasing two autobiographies. He was dyslexic, which led to difficulties in reading and writing, at school and for much of his life. [125][126][127], In 2010, Osmon Williams came forward claiming to be Ali's biological son. For other uses, see, American boxer, philanthropist and activist. He found a five-acre site on a Pennsylvania country road in the village of Deer Lake, Pennsylvania. He began training as an amateur boxer at age 12. He also developed an interest in Sufism, which he referenced in his autobiography, The Soul of a Butterfly. The study found that over 97% of Americans over 12 years of age identified both Ali and Ruth. I’m so, so tired. Even those who were assassinated, certainly lost their lives, but they didn't voluntarily do that. [24][221][222] Ali still remained active during this time, later participating as a guest referee at WrestleMania I. [35][36] Like Ali, Alexander fought for his freedom. [134] In January 2007, it was reported that they had put their home in Berrien Springs, Michigan, which they had bought in 1975,[135] up for sale and had purchased a home in eastern Jefferson County, Kentucky for $1,875,000. [87], Ali's next opponents included Chuck Wepner, Ron Lyle, and Joe Bugner. [77] Ali's first return bout was against Jerry Quarry on October 26, resulting in a win after three rounds after Quarry was cut. Muhammad Ali was one of the greatest boxers in history, the first fighter to win the world heavyweight championship on three separate occasions. Since then, he has authored some 50 books on subjects ranging from professional boxing to Beethoven. [39] (He was quoted as saying, "I said I was the greatest, not the smartest! [citation needed], Ali was a resident of Cherry Hill, New Jersey in the early 1970s. [281], On January 8, 2001, Muhammad Ali was presented with the Presidential Citizens Medal by President Bill Clinton. Following the Manila bout, Ali fought Jean-Pierre Coopman, Jimmy Young, and Richard Dunn, winning the last by knockout. He told the officer he was going to "whup" the thief. His daughter Hana later wrote that Ali once told her, "Nothing would ever shake me up (more) than the story of Emmett Till. Liston was an intimidating personality, a dominating fighter with a criminal past and ties to the mob. Ali also frequently called Frazier an "Uncle Tom". [252] By 1980, his total fight purse earnings were estimated to be up to $70 million[253] (inflation-adjusted $333 million). He defeated heavyweight kings Sonny Liston (twice), Floyd Patterson (twice), Ernie Terrell, Jimmy Ellis, Ken Norton (twice), Joe Frazier (twice), George Foreman and Leon Spinks.. The number two and three heavyweight contenders respectively, Clay and Jones fought on Jones' home turf at New York's Madison Square Garden. Muhammad Ali (right) fighting Ernie Terrell, 1967. Thus, purists cringed when Clay predicted the round in which he intended to knock out an opponent, and they grimaced when he did so and bragged about each new conquest. There is a great possibility that I will retire. He won by split decision. Now you see me, now you don't. [103] Despite pleas to definitively retire, Ali fought one last time on December 11, 1981, in Nassau, Bahamas, against Trevor Berbick, losing a ten-round decision. He was an inductee into the International Boxing Hall of Fame and held wins over seven other Hall of Fame inductees. On June 1, 1976, Ali removed his shirt and jacket and confronted professional wrestler Gorilla Monsoon in the ring after his match at a World Wide Wrestling Federation show in Philadelphia Arena. Nicknamed "the Greatest", he is widely regarded as one of the most significant and celebrated figures of the 20th century and as one of the greatest boxers of all time. Though his condition was initially described as fair, it worsened, and he died the following day at the age of 74 from septic shock.[264][265][266][267]. Auch außerhalb des Boxrings sorgte Ali für Schlagzeilen. In winning this fight at the age of 22, Clay became the youngest boxer to take the title from a reigning heavyweight champion. "[154] Ali's friendship with Malcolm X ended as Malcolm split with the Nation of Islam a couple of weeks after Ali joined, and Ali remained with the Nation of Islam. Muhammad Ali (1942-2016), nome adotado por Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr., nasceu na cidade de Louisville, Kentucky, Estados Unidos, no dia 17 de janeiro de 1942. [104][105][106], By the end of his boxing career Ali had absorbed an estimated 200,000 hits. Ali fought Terrell in Houston on February 6, 1967. [203] In 1977 the book was adapted into a film called The Greatest, in which Ali played himself and Ernest Borgnine played Angelo Dundee. ", It was around this time that Ali started struggling with vocal stutters and trembling hands. For television viewership figures of his fights, see Boxing career of Muhammad Ali: Television viewership. [306][307], When We Were Kings, a 1996 documentary about the Rumble in the Jungle, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. [262] He was released the next day. He added, "I am the greatest! Possessing a killer jump shot or the ability to stop on a dime was no longer enough. [152] Ali explained in his autobiography after studying his works, "While Clay may have gotten rid of his slaves, he "held on to white supremacy." Ali’s place in boxing history as one of the greatest fighters ever is secure. Muhammad Ali's fights were some of the world's most-watched television broadcasts, setting television viewership records. [163] In 1977, he said that, after he retired, he would dedicate the rest of his life to getting "ready to meet God" by helping people, charitable causes, uniting people and helping to make peace.
