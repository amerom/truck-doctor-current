Giganotosaurus, le lézard géant du sud, est un énorme dinosaure théropode carnivore ayant vécu en Amérique du Sud 30 millions d'années avant le Tyrannosaurus Rex. Giganotosaurus was the top predator of it’s environment and did likely hunted in groups, not only to take down large prey but to also take care of their young most likely. There's no way even the hungriest Giganotosaurus would have been foolhardy enough to attack a full-grown Argentinosaurus; so let's say, for the sake of argument, that an impromptu pack of three adults has teamed up for the job. Some researchers hypothesize that despite it’s great size, Argentinosaurus would still have had to battle with one of the biggest carnivores of the period – Giganotosaurus. Giganotosaurus Carolinii which translates as "giant southern lizard" was a large theropod dinosaur that lived in the late Cretaceous period in Argentina.

Of the two remaining meat-eaters, one has been left dangling almost comically off Argentinosaurus’ elongated neck, while the other savagely inflicts grotesque-looking, but mostly superficial, wounds under this titanosaur’s massive belly. El cráneo del Giganotosaurio tenía dientes curvos un poco anchos y aserrados, aptos para desgarrar grandes trozos de carne. If our Giganotosaurus pack had targeted a recently hatched Argentinosaurus rather than a full-grown adult, it might have been successful in its quest.

The Numbers On Argentinosaurus! The trio of carnivorous bull-lizards stepped into the glade, snouts covered with deinonychus blood. Roughly the same size as Tyrannosaurus Rex, about 40 feet from head to tail, fully grown, and weighing in the neighborhood of seven or eight tons, Giganotosaurus bore a striking resemblance to its more famous cousin, albeit with a narrower skull, longer arms, and a slightly smaller brain relative to its body size. Unfortunately, even 25 or 30 tons of combined force isn’t enough to dislodge a 100-ton obstacle, and the Giganotosaurus closest to Argentinosaurus’ rump has left itself wide open to a supersonic tail flick to the head, rendering it unconscious. Giganotosaurus carolinii vs Tyrannosaurus rex by Greg Paul. Like Giganotosaurus, Argentinosaurus is a relative newcomer to the dinosaur world, especially compared to venerable sauropods like Diplodocus and Brachiosaurus. Direct proof is lacking, but the discovery of the bones of the giant titanosaur dinosaur Argentinosaurus in the proximity of those of Giganotosaurus at least hints at an ongoing predator-prey relationship. We journey across the plains of prehistoric South America with a group of these outsized herbivores, as they encounter the strange armored sauropod Saltasaurus and the primitive bird Patagopteryx . The long-skulled Giganotosaurus, native to South America, lived during the Mesozoic Era (97 million years ago), while the massive, heavy-headed T. Rex, native to North America, lived during the Maastrichtian age of the upper Cretaceous Period (67 to 65.5 million years ago). The "type fossil" of this enormous plant-muncher was discovered by the famous paleontologist Jose F. Bonaparte in 1993, whereupon Argentinosaurus immediately assumed its position as one of the biggest dinosaurs that ever lived (though there are tantalizing hints that other South American titanosaurs, like Bruhathkayosaurus, may have been even bigger, and new candidates are being discovered practically every year). Although its remains are incomplete, Giganotosaurus was a large predator, with the known two individuals being 12.4 and possibly 13.2 meters (41-43 feet) in length, around 3.7 meters tall and weighing around 7 tonnes (15,400 lbs), making it up 90 cm longer, but significantly lighter, than \"Sue.\" The larger of the two specimens, has been considered closer in scale to the type specimen than linear scaling would produce. Some Argentinosaurus individuals may have measured over 100 feet from head to tail and weighed north of 100 tons. One of the largest sauropods that ever lived, Argentinosaurus grew up to 30 metres (100 ft) in length, making it bigger than even its relatives, such as Alamosaurus and Saltasaurus with weight estimates varying from 70 to 100 tonnes.

Argentinosaurus is a genus of giant sauropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period in what is now Argentina.Although it is only known from fragmentary remains, Argentinosaurus is one of the largest known land animals of all time, if not the largest, with length estimates ranging from 30 to 40 metres (100 to 130 ft) and weight estimates from 50 to 100 tonnes (55 to 110 short tons). Argentinosaurus: There's a reason evolution favored gigantism in dinosaurs like Argentinosaurus; out of a clutch of 15 or 20 hatchlings, only one needed to attain full maturity in order to perpetuate the breed, while the other babies and juveniles were hunted down by hungry theropods. One individual aims for the base of Argentinosaurus' long neck, while the other two butt into the titanosaur's flank simultaneously, attempting to knock it off balance. With a weight that may have been up to 14 tons (Around 8000kg) for the bigger ones, and a length between 40 and 43 feet, they defeat Sue (the largest and most complete specimen of a T-rex), who weighed about 9 tons with a length of around 40 feet.
