[3][4], In 1963, the school name was changed once more, to Kingsway College, reflecting a curriculum that included a complete academic program while decreasing the implication that the school was only a Bible college. The College offers a huge array of academic and vocational courses from entry levels right through to HE for young and adult learners. As enrollment increased, so did the farms. Enrollment decreased again during World War II, but following the war, the college enjoyed a period of expansion, reaching 200 students by the end of the 1950s. By 1996, Kingsway Greenhouse was privatized and has since become Oshawa's largest garden centre. Westminster Kingsway College is a further education college in central London with centres in Kings Cross, London  and Regent's Park  in Camden, together with Victoria  (1910) and Soho  centres in Westminster. Under Coupland the choir became the first Kingsway group to begin extensively touring across eastern Canada and the north-eastern United States.
