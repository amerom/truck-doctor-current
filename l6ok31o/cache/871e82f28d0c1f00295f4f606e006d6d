You can make your own using rigid mineral wool, fiberglass or bonded acoustic cotton panels. The typical rating for single pane windows is 18-20 while a double glazed window is 28-32. It is less a sound absorber, and more a sound blocker. Styrofoam or polystyrene boards work well for exterior wall applications or can be combined with mineral wool or fiberglass panels in interior wall cavities as an impressive sound absorbing, deadening, and sound decoupling barrier. Like the fluffy insulation though, it too is susceptible to moisture and mold. Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz) and represents the tone (frequency) or musical value of a sound. Insulate the wall cavities with a high R-value insulation; the higher the R-value, the more sound absorbed or blocked. It is a loose material which traps air, which in turn can trap or absorb sound waves. Spray foam is polyurethane foam that provides not only thermal insulation but also acoustic insulation. Higher STC ratings are even better. It has an NRC rating of 1.0, performing better at the upper test frequency than the lower end, so low-frequency noise is still an issue. The more feedback you give us, the better our pages can be. Additionally, the panels are fire, water, moisture and rot resistant. Extruded boards are closed cell foam, so it’s safe to say it has an STC of 37. For residential locations, an STC 52 for bedrooms and STC 56 for bathrooms, living rooms and kitchens, are recommended minimums. The boards can also be wrapped and hung for use within music or multi-media rooms to dampen sound. Loose fill cellulose has an STC of 44 and an NRC of 0.8. Sound Transmission Class (STC) A commonly used measure of soundproofing effectiveness is the sound transmission class, or STC.It is a single number that attempts to characterize the overall ability … It can also be framed and covered in acoustic fabric for use as sound absorbing panels in media or music rooms, or anywhere you want to reduce sound transfer and feedback. It’s great for keeping the cold or heat in or out, but not a good sound absorber. How loud a sound is, is measured in decibels or dB on a sound pressure scale. It is manufactured from a mix of mineral wool from molten rock and slag, and combined with new glass wool process. With sound absorbing ratings of 95% and NRC of 1.05, high performance mineral wool provides improved sound reducing values. It is a dense and porous material that slows the movement of heat and cold through walls, floors and ceilings. Simply put, it measures how much sound a wall, for instance, will block from getting through to the other side. This is usu- ally because there is a pronounced dip in the test curve and the STC rating is heavily influenced by a measurement in one fre- quency band. A 2×4 wall with ½” of drywall on both sides, but no insulation, has an STC 33 rating. Sound can still go through it, but some sound doesn’t. A partition is given an STC rating by measuring its Transmission Loss over a range of 16 different frequencies between 125-4000 Hz. Offset electrical boxes in different wall cavities. Cellulose insulation is composed of 75-85% recycled paper fiber with the remainder being made up of fire retardant mater. do not perform any better than standard batt insulation. When used in standard partition wall construction, it can increase the wall STC rating to between 51 and 55. Sound insulation can help improve our comfort and even our health. Adding insulation after construction, short of renovating, isn’t practical. Installing insulation  within a wall or floor/ceiling cavity will improve the STC rating by about 4-6  It is rounded to the nearest 0.05 increment. It depends on a multitude of factors: pre or post construction, construction techniques, inside the wall, ceiling or floor cavities, hanging on a wall, whole house or select spaces, type of noise, and BUDGET. Use it in recreation areas to deaden noise and impact sounds, and multimedia rooms reduce sound transfer. I began looking at ways to improve the sound quality of my home and to make a soundproof office for myself. No sound is being absorbed or reflected at 0, and all sound is absorbed or reflected at 1. The International Building Code (IBC) recommends a rating of STC 50 for walls, ceilings, and floors as a minimum requirement. It has higher R-values per inch of thickness, which also makes it a better noise blocker. Dense pack cellulose has an STC of 44 to 68 and an NRC of 0.9. Polystyrene or Styrofoam products are used for camp coolers and coffee cups, so they have thermal properties. Acoustics.com acoustical consultants can help architects & interior designers with Private Offices by providing advice & information on acoustic products & materials, ceilings, Reverberation Time, noise … Grade B is … What is a good STC rating? These linings are … However, any compression of the fiberglass reduces both the R-value and the absorption ability. The STC Rating is 67db and the IIC Rating is 68, perfect for condos and apartments! It doesn’t have the density though to block them. The boards are also available to fit into drop ceiling grids too, to further reduce sound transfer between rooms and floors. Remember, the STC rating … New products and techniques are always being developed and marketed, so if you’re building or renovating, keep up to date. The STC rating of this type of assembly can range from STC 58 with one layer of ½-inch gypsum board on each side of wood studs up to STC 67 with two layers of 5 ⁄ 8 -inch gypsum board on each side. Their tendency to compress and slump reduces their noise absorption abilities. High performance mineral wool is lightweight insulation with improved thermal and acoustic properties. Cellulose has an STC range from 44 to 68 and an NRC between 0.8 and 0.9 depending on its density. a substantial increase in isolation. Fiberglass panels have an STC of 42 and an NRC ranging from 0.50 to 0.95, depending on the product specs. I’ve used it for all of those and am amazed at the differences it made not only to improve the thermal barrier but sound also. Polyisocyanurate (ISO) panels are also extruded, and better at insulating than the pink or blue panels, but more expensive. Great for all room applications, but especially rooms you want to reduce feedback in and sound transfer from. I wondering if it would do any good to fill the space between floor joists with insulation to help stop sound transfer to the upstairs. Soundproof caulking used between drywall and studs and around outlets can further reduce sound transfer. Our STC Sound Blocking curtains work due their inner linings. They create a resonating tunnel for sound vibrations! It is more rigid than other batts but is a pre-construction product. It is based on 4 frequencies of 250Hz, 500Hz, 1000Hz, and 2000Hz which are the typical range of speech. It will reduce sound transfer between rooms and add density to the walls to minimize feedback and echo making it easier to hear clearly in the rooms. The same frequency can be generated by different objects and produce different tones. The higher the STC number, the better the sound control.
