</body></html>";s:4:"text";s:18367:"[11], The vast majority (97%) of Canadian oil production occurs in three provinces: Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador. Geologists realized that they had completely misunderstood the geology of Alberta, and the highly prolific Leduc oil field, which has since produced over 50,000,000 m3 (310,000,000 bbl) of oil was not a unique formation. Oil sands is the main contributor to the growth and the largest source of supply, accounting for over 60% of the volumes produced in 2019. It had the oldest commercial oil well in North America (dug by hand in 1858 at Oil Springs, Ontario, a year before the Drake Well was drilled in Pennsylvania), and having the oldest producing oil field in North America (producing crude oil continuously since 1861). Vassiliou, Marius (2018). Two of the largest producers of petrochemicals in North America are located in central and north central Alberta. In 2017 Canada imported 405,700 bbl/day (barrels per day) and exported 1,115,000 bbl/day of refined petroleum products.[5][6]. [18] The hydrogen sulfide removed in the refining and processing of crude oil and natural gas is subsequently converted into byproduct elemental sulfur. The latest oil production cuts will do little to improve the outlook for the oil sands, making Cenovus Energy Inc. (TSX:CVE)(NYSE:CVE) an oil stock to avoid. Crude Oil Production in Canada averaged 2188.38 BBL/D/1K from 1973 until 2020, reaching an all time high of 4670 BBL/D/1K in December of 2019 and a record low of 955 BBL/D/1K in April of 1982. Canada is the world's fourth-largest oil producing country. Calgary also has regional offices of all six major Canadian banks, some 4,300 petroleum, energy and related service companies, and 1,300 financial service companies, helping make it the second largest head office city in Canada after Toronto. In 2017 it produced an average of 667,747 cubic metres per day (4.2 Mbbl/d) of crude oil and equivalent. [69] Although both pipeline and rail transportation are generally quite safe, neither mode is without risk. [35], Extensive drilling was done in the Canadian Arctic during the 1970s and 1980s by such companies as Panarctic Oils Ltd., Petro Canada and Dome Petroleum. Canada's steam-driven oil facilities are bearing the brunt of output cuts as the industry copes with low prices, and deeper reductions may risk permanent damage to the sites. [70][71] Between 2004 and 2015, the likelihood of rail accidents in Canada was 2.6 times greater than for pipelines per thousand barrels of oil equivalents (Mboe). [56] The major oil pipelines exiting Western Canada have a design transport capacity of 4.0 million b/d. In 2015 Alberta produced an average of 492,265 cubic metres per day (3.1 Mbbl/d) of Canada's 621,560 cubic metres per day (3.9 Mbbl/d) of oil and equivalent production. [55] In 2016, however, the pipeline capacity was estimated at 3.9 million b/d,[57] and in 2017 the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) estimated the pipeline capacity to be 3.3 million b/d. The NewGrade Energy Upgrader, part of the. The fallout: Virtually every barrel of oil produced there will come at a loss at a time when the energy industry generates 10% of Canada’s gross domestic product and a fifth of its exports. Consisting of a massive wedge of sedimentary rock up to 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) thick extending from the Rocky Mountains in the west to the Canadian Shield in the east, it is far distant from Canada's east and west coast ports as well as its historical industrial centres. Mirbabayev, Miryusif F. (2017) Brief history of the first drilled oil well; and people involved - "Oil-Industry History" (USA), v.18, #1, pages 25-34. Saskatchewan Fuel, Flare, and Vent 1. Chapter 13 - Technology and the Canadian Heavy Oil Industry More information Download Downloads: 73; Chapter 14.1 - Appendix 1: Canada's Oil Sands and Heavy Oil … 2. Since January 2019, production limits, which align production with export capacity, have aimed to protect the value of Alberta oil and prevent Canadian crude from being sold at discounted prices. Development of the massive oil sand reserves in Alberta would be facilitated by enhancing the North American pipeline network which would transport dilbit to refineries or export facilities.[52]. According to EIA's February Short-Term Energy Outlook, production of petroleum and other liquids in Canada, which totaled 4.5 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2015, is expected to average 4.6 million b/d in 2016 and 4.8 million b/d in 2017. [50] There are four main pipeline groups: gathering, feeder, transmission, and distribution pipelines. However, due to the recent nature of the discoveries there are not yet any plans to develop them. [62] In the United States, Democrats are concerned that Keystone XL would simply facilitate getting Alberta oil sands products to tidewater for export to China and other countries via the American Gulf Coast of Mexico. There were hundreds more Devonian reef formations like it underneath Alberta, many of them full of oil. Canada's unique geography, geology, resources and patterns of settlement have been key factors in the history of Canada. [63] The proposed 2,440-km railway would be capable of transporting 1 million to 1.5 million b/d of bitumen and petroleum products, as well as other commodities, to tidewater[64] (avoiding the tanker ban along British Columbia's northern coast). Each report contains data for one calendar year. 1 struck oil in a suburb of Edmonton, Alberta. But pre-COVID-19 plans and stimulus measures point to a continuation of the growing global fossil fuel production gap, locking in severe climate disruption, the report said. A report also calls on UK oil and gas firms to phase out production in the North Sea and make the transition to renewable energy sources. The country’s oil supply has grown steadily and averaged around 4.45 million bpd last year. Canada  has the third largest oil reserves   in the world and is the world's fourth largest oil producer  and fourth largest oil exporter. [74] For crude oil transported from the North Dakota Bakken Formation, air pollution and greenhouse gas emission costs are substantially larger for rail compared to pipeline. [4] Although Canada is one of the largest oil producers and exporters in the world, it also imports significant amounts of oil into its eastern provinces since its oil pipelines do not extend all the way across the country and many of its oil refineries cannot handle the types of oil its oil fields produce. Of this, 2.2 mb/d was produced from the oil sands and the remaining 1.6 mb/d was conventional, offshore, and tight oil production. It is also far from American industrial centres. In 1938 the Alberta provincial government responded to the conspicuous and wasteful burning of natural gas. Canada holds the fourth spot among the world's leading oil producers, with an average production of 5.50 million b/d in 2019, accounting for 5% of global production. In 2014, Canada produced 3.8 mb/d of crude oil. [22], Saskatchewan is Canada's second-largest oil-producing province after Alberta, producing about 13.5% of Canada's petroleum in 2015. Closed Captioning and Described Video is available for many CBC shows offered on CBC Gem. 44% of Canadian oil production in 2007 was from oil sands. [37] In addition, after the Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, new rules were introduced which discouraged companies from drilling in the Canadian Arctic offshore. As a result, Canada built its major manufacturing centres near its historic hydroelectric power sources in Ontario and Quebec, rather than its petroleum resources in Alberta and Saskatchewan. 6. The resulting decline in production royalties earned by the provincial governments of Alberta and Saskatchewan (which are paid to the federal government) has adversely impacted the Canadian economy. [10] While Petro Canada was once owned by the Canadian government, it is now owned by Suncor Energy, which continues to use the Petro Canada label for marketing purposes. The upstream oil sector is also commonly known as the exploration and production (E&P) sector.[46][47][48].
