[22], The Spanish authorities learned of La Salle's expedition when a former member of the colony, Denis Thomas, was captured aboard a pirate ship. Lets play dragon wars - Der absolute Testsieger unserer Produkttester. La Belle was wrecked in present-day Matagorda Bay the following year, dooming La Salle's Texas colony to failure. As they got underway, a cold front blew in. In 1835 they won approval as a supplier of Marine engines to the British Royal Navy. The Normandie built in 1835, was a French paddle steamer working in conjunction with her sister ship the Seine (1836) on the lower reaches of the Seine. After a several-year negotiation, an agreement was signed on March 31, 2003 which gives official title to the wreck and its artifacts to the Musée national de la Marine in Paris. At that point, La Salle's men would assemble the ship, and it would be used to carry the supplies to their final destination. [8]  The pieces were intended to be loaded onto Le Joly for transport to North America, and then would be carried overland to the Mississippi River. [2], The Dorades were small steamers which plied between Rouen (at the Quai de' Harcourt, opposite the hotel de Rouen) and Paris. In an effort to "invigorate" the industry,  Secretary of State of the Navy, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, brought shipbuilders trained in the Mediterranean methods of shipbuilding to Rochefort, where the industry primarily used what was known as the Atlantic shipbuilding method. Before Minet returned to France aboard the Joly, he had created detailed maps of Matagorda Bay and the pass and had marked the spot where L'Aimable had sunk. [21]  Beaujeu, having fulfilled his mission in escorting them, returned to France aboard the Joly in mid-March, leaving La Belle the only ship available to the remaining settlers. [5], La Salle originally intended to sail to New France, journey overland to the Illinois Country, and then sail down the Mississippi River to its mouth, where he would plant his colony.

[32], The Spanish salvaged two swivel guns and five cannons from the ship, as well as the anchor, some cordage, and the masts, which they made into oars.

[12], On 10 December 1840 she had the honour of receiving the ashes Napoléon from the Belle Poule at Cherbourg. The whereabouts of this cannon remain a mystery, and no other clear signs of prior artifact recovery were observed at the wreck site. [39] The hull of the ship and many of the recovered artifacts, including colored glass beads, brass pots, a colander, a ladle, muskets, powder horns, an early explosive device called a fire pot and a bronze cannon with lifting handles shaped like dolphins, are on display at the Bullock Texas State History Museum in the state capital of Austin. [4] On his return to France in 1683, La Salle argued that a small number of Frenchmen could successfully invade New Spain by relying on the help of 15,000 Indians who were angry over Spanish enslavement. [7]  Originally, La Belle was built as a kit, with the ship frames assigned to one of four quadrants and numbered sequentially so that the pieces could be assembled later. At the end of October La Salle decided to undertake a longer expedition and reloaded the La Belle with much of the remaining supplies. The recovered timbers were eventually reassembled in a special cradle and vat designed at Texas A&M University's Nautical Archaeology Program, the institution in charge of the conservation of all the artifacts recovered from the shipwreck site after 1995.

List of shipwrecks: 5 January 1909 Ship Country Description Anglo-African United Kingdom The 4,186 GRT steamer on a passage from Tocopilla for Baltimore with a cargo of 7,000 tons of nitrates ran aground around 21:30 in thick weather five miles (8.0 km) south of Cape Henry.Attempts were made to move the vessel, and salvage tugs were employed but unsuccessfully. [2] La Salle proposed establishing a colony at the mouth of the Mississippi, providing a base for promoting Christianity among the native peoples as well as a convenient location for attacking Nueva Vizcaya and gaining control of its lucrative silver mines.

[27] After three months of searching overland, La Salle's group returned, but were unable to find the La Belle where they had left her and were forced to walk back to the fort. Under international naval laws, an official naval vessel is owned by the country for which the ship flies its flag. She was over 190 tons, and could carry 1000 passengers. After a small Indian canoe washed ashore one day, the survivors were able to paddle across the bay and return to the fort. The oscillating cylinder steam engines for both the ‘’Normandie’’ and the ‘’Seine’’  were built by Barnes Miller, Ravenhill and Co. of Glasshouse Fields, Ratcliffe, London. Although Thomas was quickly hanged, the Spanish believed his information to be reliable and began searching for the French colony. A lack of funding for the next seventeen years stymied further attempts to locate La Belle.[35]. [2] She was built in Le Havre by M. Lenormand. La Belle was one of Robert de La Salle's four ships when he explored the Gulf of Mexico with the ill-fated mission of starting a French colony at the mouth of the Mississippi River in 1685. The team of state archaeologists spent one month diving on the wreckage, documenting its extent and condition, and recovering a number of artifacts. One complete human skeleton was discovered, that of a middle-aged male with signs of arthritis. The 1.5 million dollar structure was paid for by the state of Texas, though private funding and federal grants would fund much of the subsequent excavation. In a magnetometer survey of the area of the bay deemed a high probability to be La Belle's location, the expedition found several more recent shipwrecks. [25] Several of the men, including the captain of the La Belle, Canil Maraud, died on this expedition from eating prickly pear. Day-to-day control was granted to the Texas Historical Commission for 99 years. Fieldwork was completed by May 1997, after which the cofferdam was disassembled and sold. La Belle was one of Robert de La Salle's four ships when he explored the Gulf of Mexico with the ill-fated mission of starting a French colony at the mouth of the Mississippi River in 1685. Spain claimed Florida, and New Spain included both today's Mexico and much of the southwestern part of the continent. Despite a long-standing tradition repeated by American historians that La Belle was a personal gift from the King to La Salle, no documentary evidence confirming this claim could be produced. The discovery of La Salle's flagship was regarded as one of the most important archaeological finds of the century in Texas, and a major excavation was launched by the state of Texas that, over a period of about a year, recovered the entire shipwreck and over a million artifacts. The first team of divers reported feeling musket balls on the seafloor along with loose fragments of wood moving in the current created by the blower. [10]  The ship was designed to be highly maneuverable, with the mainmast and foremast holding two sails each, while the mizzenmast supported a single triangular sail, and another small square sail hung from the bowsprit. The men were seen struggling against a strong wind to return to the ship as night fell, and were presumed lost when the longboat never arrived at the ship. Since the remaining crewmembers were unskilled, they were unable to keep control of the ship, and because they had lost their second anchor, there was no way to stop the ship from drifting in the wind. [19] The expedition was to be unable to find the Mississippi due to a combination of inaccurate maps, La Salle's previous miscalculation of the latitude of the mouth of the Mississippi River, and overcorrecting for the currents. Barnes left the business that year to go on his own, and from that point the company was known as Miller and Ravenhill. It is not known exactly how much sediment covered the shipwreck at the time of its discovery because the prop-wash blower was deployed before sending divers down. [18] None of the members of the expedition had ever been in the Gulf of Mexico or knew how to navigate it. In June 1995 the Texas Historical Commission organized a second magnetometer survey to search high-probability areas not included in earlier surveys. [25] He took 50 men, plus the La Belle's crew of 27 sailors, leaving behind 34 men, women, and children. [6]  Louis XIV gave La Salle the use of two ships, Le Joly and La Belle. Die Seine ([sɛn]; Seine?/i auf Französisch; lateinisch/keltisch Sequana) ist ein Fluss in Nordfrankreich. [26][28], While La Salle was gone, the ship began to run low of drinking water.
