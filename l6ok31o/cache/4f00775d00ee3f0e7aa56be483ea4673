In 2016, Chromebooks accounted for  58 percent of mobile devices shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States, up from less than 1 percent in 2012, according to Futuresource Consulting, the research firm. It was an opportune moment for Google to pitch lower-cost laptops to schools.                  This is a cross-post from onlinecolleges.net The form is web-based and can be shared with respondents by sending a link, emailing a message, or embedding it into a web page or blog post. Every year, several million American students graduate from high school. Search the world's information, including webpages, images, videos and more. In the audience, Jason Markey, principal of East Leyden High School in Franklin Park, Ill., was converted. Students and teachers can use Google Forms to make surveys, quizzes, or event registration sheets. “Google Classroom was key to that.”. Here are some things to consider: Google Classroom is easy to use. Easy to use and accessible from all devices. Let's share how different schools and colleges use Google Apps for learning and share resources with each other. Ms. Hahn, who now works for the same health care company as Mr. Tidmarsh, agrees.                  Top 3 Recommendations for Organizing Google Classroom Use the Classwork Page to Organize Student Resources and Assignments The default for Google Classroom is the "Stream", but we recommend that you only use the youtubstream for announcements. But by habituating students to its offerings at a young age, Google obtains something much more valuable. When Google’s education strategy proved successful at the college level, Jaime Casap, the company’s global education evangelist, decided to apply it to public schools. Because the district wasn’t yet using Google’s apps, she said, she independently set up six consumer accounts for her class. In the fall of 2011, Google invited school administrators to its Chicago office to meet Mr. Casap, hoping to interest them in Chromebooks. After the Chicago schools tested Classroom, she said, members of Google’s education team started directly contacting her when they were seeking educators to try out the company’s innovations. It has enlisted teachers and administrators to promote Google’s products to other schools. Bout said of Google’s growth strategy for education. But that also caused problems in Chicago and another district when Google went looking for teachers to try a new app — effectively bypassing district administrators. More than half the nation’s primary- and secondary-school students — more than 30 million children — use Google education apps, the company says. Mr. Casap, the Google education evangelist, likes to recount Google’s emergence as an education powerhouse as a story of lucky coincidences. By then, Google was developing a growth strategy aimed at teachers — the gatekeepers to the classroom — who could influence the administrators who make technology decisions. Soon, teachers began to talk up Google on social media and in sessions at education technology conferences. About 20 percent of his students lacked home internet access, he said. Check out Collaborate to the Core, which gives you great lessons, tips, and ideas on how to further collaborative learning. “It was a tough announcement to make,” he conceded. By then, Google had developed a simplified, low-cost laptop called the Chromebook. They could gain access to their documents no matter which Chromebook they used. Now Google wanted Chicago Public Schools to switch on the app districtwide, she said, before determining whether it complied with local student-protection policies. Soon, so many educators were visiting Leyden to see its tech setup that the district started an annual conference to host them. Chicago Public Schools, the third-largest school district in the country, decided in 2012 to adopt Google’s platform. The fact that Chicago schools were vetting Google products, like the Classroom app, gave administrators a welcome counternarrative of the district’s altruistically helping Google debug its products for schools across the country. “Our goal is to build products that help educators and students,” Mr. Rochelle said. And Google offered a robust way for districts to manage thousands of computers online: They could lock Chromebooks remotely so that students could not search the web during tests, or disable missing ones.
