Another great Anglo-Norman lineage like the Burkes, the Butlers descend from Theobald Walter who also came to Ireland with John in 1185, and whose brother was the archbishop of Canterbury. A similar multi-ancestral situation must explain the common occurance of the name Fleming, denoting an ethnic Dutch speaker, originally from Flanders in what is today Belgium.

Other ‘true’ Irish Joyces must be those of the Kilkenny/Wexford area, whose sixteenth century ancestors styled themselves Josse. descended from Cambro-Norman aristocrats. Many Irish Joyces have Galway origins, being descendants of the Joyce ‘clan’ who established themselves in Connemara during the thirteenth century and who later formed a sept along Gaelic lines there.
