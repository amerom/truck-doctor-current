Beneficial economic aspects of fungi : Besides so many harmful i.e. Eubacteria is found in the digestive system to help break down food. To date, many industrial processes are performed using chemical compounds, which are harmful to nature. Economic Importance of the Archaea Because they have enzymes that can function at high temperatures, considerable effort is being made to exploit the archaea for commercial processes such as providing enzymes to be added to detergents (maintain their activity at high temperatures and pH); an enzyme to covert corn starch into dextrins. How does archaebacteria produce antibiotics if it cant react to antibiotics? Economic importance of Bacteria . The importance of methanogenic bacteria associated with ciliate protozoa was estimated either by removing protozoa from whole rumen fluid (using defaunated rumen fluid to correct for the effects of centrifugation on bacteria) or by isolating the protozoa. Plants are species in Kingdom Plantae. Higher substrate solubility in the presence of an organic solvent can be useful in synthetic reactions catalyzed by enzymes from extreme halophiles (21). reply . B.

On the contrary of bacteria, archaea don't carry viruses that can be harmful for us. Archaea - Archaea - Characteristics of the archaea: Although the domains Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya were founded on genetic criteria, biochemical properties also indicate that the archaea form an independent group within the prokaryotes and that they share traits with both the bacteria and the eukaryotes.

Archaebacteria are primitive prokaryotes and are adapted to thrive in extreme environments like hot springs, high salinity, low pH and so on. Methanogens are microorganisms that produce methane as a metabolic byproduct in hypoxic conditions. Fig: Archaebacteria. Fungi are both useful as well as harmful to humankind in several ways, some of which are summarized below: c. Synthesis of proteins and fats : Proteins are synthesized from yeasts, where as fats from Penicillium and Aspergillus sp. They are prokaryotes and unicellular. Bacteria are the most abundant group of microorganisms in nature.It is found everywhere on the planet,such as hot spring,deep ocean,deserts and even thrive inside our intestine.The term bacterium was given by Ehrenberg.The branch which is deals with bacteria is known as Bacteriology.Unlike many organisms,bacteria have no natural death. Economic Importance of Bacteria Nitrogen Fixation – All organisms need nitrogen to make proteins – Bacteria convert nitrogen to a form organisms can use Recycling of Nutrients – Necessary to breakdown the organic matter in dead organisms and wastes, returning nutrients to the soil 21. Manjunatha S I M.Sc. "Archae" stands for "ancient", archaebacteria are thought to evolve from the very ancient lineage of bacterial cells that used to inhabit the sulfur-rich deep sea vents.
