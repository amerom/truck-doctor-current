The first time I saw it, clicking up from Anthony Bourdain (finally, a reason to watch CNN) on 1202, to Rachel Maddow on 1215, I was surprised, and a bit disoriented, to discover on 1208 an ad-free, non-ideological, non-snarky, non-infuriating, non-boring, nonstop rundown of news I needed to know.

By Marty Kaplan huffpost.com — Yale law school professor Dan Kahan's new research paper is called "Motivated Numeracy and Enlightened Self-Government," but for me a better title is the headline on science writer Chris Mooney's piece about it in Grist: "Science Confirms: Politics Wrecks Your Ability to … The anchor quit soon after. On the week of August 24, former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin guest hosted a program on the network. Production teams planned entire news hours only to scrap them minutes before showtime because somewhere out there Trump was talking. “[Herring] is the network,” a former anchor told me. In October 2018, on the day Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court, applause carried audibly through the building.

Robert Herring subsequently denied the deal, adding that Hicks Equity Partners was not the only interested buyer. Don Kaplan … Nielsen, he emphasized, and not Comscore, is the industry standard. In March 2015, USC media professor Marty Kaplan praised the network for its focus on what he viewed as impartial news reporting, writing in The Huffington Post that, "Ten minutes of OAN … As soon as he understood that his staff had the ability to write the news, he began sending the news team must-run stories, often from far-right websites such as Breitbart and the Gateway Pundit, whose penchant for conspiracy aligned with Herring’s own seemingly insulated worldview, former employees say. “Your ratings are going up because you are doing a great job. “Our news anchors are NOT allowed to express their opinion,” he wrote to me in an email. “We’d be getting ready for the 1am, and he would be commenting on it,” Kyle Warnke, a former producer, says. In a recent segment on the coronavirus, Jack Posobiec—a semi-prominent alt-right troll who was instrumental in propagating the 2016 “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory, and who is a political correspondent for OAN—suggests he was.

Robert Herring, OAN’s CEO, on November 9, 2016. Herring had hired only a handful of anchors, some production assistants, and four directors, only two of whom, including Soltero, had news experience. Its aim: access, and praise. (“If you keep running stories about Tesla, and the stock keeps going down, I may not be able to afford you all,” a former employee recalls him telling the newsroom. Marty Kaplan. In the end, Herring relented—even if he insisted on calling the producers who were brought on board “story pickers.”, But Herring quickly assumed control. Until they double their penetration, instead of running cash-for-gold and thigh-master commercials, they're slicing up the news hour with splendor-and-beauty footage from around the world, plus 60-second bits of Americana, like the story of the Pony Express, and John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry. ~~PC'~ November 13, 1919 MEMORANDUM FOR JIM JOHNSON FROM: MIKE BERMAI.

OAN does this largely by licensing its news content from respected syndicators like Euronews and Reuters (and not from the Washington Times, which seems to have fallen off OAN's map). “But fairly quickly, it was more like the Sahara.”, Employees fed up with the network’s skewed coverage had already begun to leave over the previous year. And when they strayed, the story was killed. Kaplan wrote in a 2015 article for HuffPost that “the Herrings have so far walked the talk about walling off opinion programming from news… Minute for minute, and nearly 24/7, OAN delivers more hard news about America and the world, more impartially, with less attitude, less lighting up of our lizard brains, and less of a makes-you-want-to-take-a-shower factor, than any other news on TV.” He worked briefly in pet stores—“he once casually informed me that he knows how to anally express a poodle,” a second former anchor told me—and in the 1960s became a salesman for a circuit board manufacturer in Orange County.
