The (antagonist) muscles on the other side of the joint from the direction of motion performed are strained and/or spasmed, causing the client to feel pain when these muscles are stretched. If the client also experiences pain with passive motion, then the client has either a sprain, because ligaments and joint capsules are still being moved, or a strain or spasm of the antagonist muscles, because they are still being stretched. Each of these conditions can cause pain with both active and passive ROM, and neither condition causes pain with resisted motion. Passive range-of-motion: The therapist or equipment moves the joint through the range of motion without any effort from the patient. The challenge is discerning pain that occurs from a sprain (resulting from ligaments/joint capsules being moved) from pain that occurs from a strain/spasm of the antagonist muscles (resulting from the antagonist muscles being moved/stretched).
