Thesis advisors offer help during this initial stage. You may need to obtain information from more than one source for an assignment topic. 1. Source When to use Reference Material Reference books, such as dictionaries, handbooks, The process described here simplifies choosing a topic for a research paper and narrowing it down. 2. The importance of a background study in research can be summarized as three main key points. That way, you can be on the lookout for a topic that may interest you. in order to characterize it in detail and to potentially reveal important/ interesting/ undescribed aspects or patterns. An instructor may assign you a specific topic, but most often instructors require you to select your own topic of interest. Scoping your topic is the process of identifying the important subtopics that form the parameters of your speech. Unfortunately, when this happens it results in a loss of data, time, and money. The ability to develop a good research topic is an important skill. You may be able to tell from the title of the book/article or the journal title. I do need to include why abortion is an important topic and why it is so controversial topic. Identify a gap in the literature . Well my thesis is basically where i stand on abortion either pro life or pro choice. I cannot stress this point enough: research takes a long time, often much more time than you expect it will, so do not choose a topic or jump onto someoneâs research project unless you are truly interested in the subject matter. A research question is a sentence that defines what you will examine, within which population, and what the outcome of interest will be. A very prevalent myth in the therapy world is that research is ". A literature review surveys books, scholarly articles, and any other sources relevant to a particular issue, area of research, or theory, and by so doing, provides a description, summary, and critical evaluation of these works in relation to the research problem being investigated. If you are researching global warming activism for a political science class, an article on global warming from a chemistry journal will not be relevant. Knowing the discipline of an article is an important clue in determining relevance. An ideal business administration topic is one that you are interested to learn more about. the time limitation defined by Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies). A semester paper or a project paper at the university is based on a research topic. But not all of it is true especially today, where sharing information is much easier through the use of the internet. Select a Topic . Those who go through the steps outlined by this process will be able to identify their topics more precisely while making their research efforts more efficient. For these students â possibly the enviable few â suggestions for help with choosing a research topic may be unnecessary. The first step when planning and writing a research paper is picking a good topic. First, choose a strong topic and one you're interested in. Different information is available in different sources so it is important to choose those which will provide relevant information. Finding the ideal research problem does not mean simply selecting a topic from possibilities presented by your adviser or having such a topic assigned to you, attractive as this may first appear. 3 The background to the study â why it is an important and interesting topic to study. Typically, assignments in which students are given the opportunity to choose the topic require the topic to be relevant to some aspect of the course; so, keep this in mind as you begin a course in which you know there will be a research paper near the end. Before formulating your research question, note that there are 3 important types of research questions: descriptive â these employ careful and comprehensive observation of a phenomenon/ event, subject, trait, etc. Choosing your research topic is an important step in writing a literature review. To me, the question "Why is the research you're interested in important" is not the same as "Why are you interested in the research topic?". but to me, it really means "How does your work fit in with current human knowledge about this topic? Choosing the right research topic is quite often a daunting task, especially for PhD students.
