An image analysis included the integrity and tear site of the deltoid ligament, and other associated injuries. A deltoid ligament, also known as a medial ligament, is a triangular shaped band that binds the tibia to the inner bony protrusions on the side of the ankle. When the deltoid ligament ruptures, a “bimalleolar equivalent” ankle fracture occurs, and the surgeon is presented with several diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Made up of both superficial and deep fibers, it is one of the strongest ligaments in the human body. Swelling and tenderness over both the deltoid and syndesmosis ligaments are the most common physical findings.
