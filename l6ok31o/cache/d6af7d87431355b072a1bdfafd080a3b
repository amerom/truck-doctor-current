The genus Capnocytophaga is composed of a group of capnophilic, gram-negative fusiform bacteria that are part of the normal oral flora in humans and animals.Capnocytophaga species have been identified as the cause of a variety of infections in immunocompetent hosts ().In immunocompromised and neutropenic patients, Capnocytophaga spp. Morphology: Capnocytophaga: CELLULAR : Staining: Gram-negative: Morphology: Short to elongate flexible rods or filaments, 0.42-0.6 um in diameter and 2.5-5.7 um in length. C. canimorsus was recently shown to be endowed with a capsular polysaccharide implicated in resistance to the innate immune system of the host. Mally et al. no, Capnocytophaga are catalase and oxidase negative. The authors suggested that they could differentiate C. canimorsus and C. cynodegmi on colony morphology; this is not supported by the original colony description and is not our experience. MORPHOLOGY OF NEISSERIA MENINGITIDIS (MENINGOCOCCUS). What is the colony morphology for Capnocytophaga species? Capnocytophaga infection can cause serious complications, including heart attack, kidney failure, and gangrene. small nonhemolytic pale beige or yellowish gliding motility: Term. capnophilic, glucose fermenter, oxidase +, catalase + and indole - Supporting users have an ad free experience! Here, we developed the first C. canimorsus capsular serotyping scheme. long, thin tapered rods. Colonies are butyrous and smooth Gram Stain . Tweet . A sample of plaque was removed from a periodontal pocket of a patient with gum disease.  Cells can be pleomorphic: Motility: No flagella; motile by gliding. My Flashcards. Capnocytophaga colony morphology: Definition. Heterogeneity within these species, their frequency in dogs, and pathogenicity factors are largely unknown. Capnocytophaga canimorsus, formerly known as “dysgonic fermenter 2” [ 1 ], is a slowly growing, capnophilic, fusiform, and filamentous gram-negative rod. Size – The size of Neisseria meningitidis is about 0.6 µm – 0.8 µm (micrometer).. What does the gram stain look like for Capnocytophaga species? Capnocytophaga on Chocolate agar. Bacterial Growth Patterns and Colony Types The Simple Stains Bacterial Morphology The Kirby Bauer Method and E Test for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing Pathogenic Bacteria and Identification Mass Spectrometry ... Capnocytophaga. Flat colonies, irregular in shape. Ends of cells usually round to tapered. Capnocytophaga canimorsus can be a virulent pathogen, whereas C. cynodegmi is of low virulence. Tiny, 0.2–0.7 μm pleomorphic, poorly stained Gram stain morphology showed thin, faintly staining Gram-negative fusiform bacilli. Colony Morphology ..Aerobic, fastidious, requires cysteine for growth.Grows poorly on Blood Agar (BA) Chocolate Agar (CA): tiny, grey-white, opaque colonies, 1-2 mm ≥48hr . Definitive identification of the organism using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) was attempted but failed because of an inadequate database of prior Capnocytophaga isolates at our institution. In 1976, it was first reported to cause septicemia, endocarditis, and meningitis in humans [ 2 ]. Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a dog oral commensal that causes rare but severe infections in humans. Some people may need to have fingers, toes, or even limbs amputated because of complications from severe infection. Are Capnocytophaga species oxidase and catalase positive? This image shows different species of oral bacterial colonies, including Capnocytophaga and Aggregatibacter, growing on an agar plate. About 3 in 10 people who develop a severe infection die.
