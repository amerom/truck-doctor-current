This framework builds reward schemes where the energy end-users could benefit financially from saving energy, by receiving coins according to their real consumption compared to the predicted consumption if no actions were to take place. adoption  stage,  there  are  a  lot  of  unrealistic  proposals  and, limitations  of  blockchain,  its  possible, indicate [39], [40], a blockchain technology is still at the in, sector,  for  example,  Lamberti  [41]  indicates  that  insurance, implemented, customers served, etc.) Collaborative NIDSs for cloud-based blockchain applications are also explained to demonstrate how blockchain can address challenges related to data privacy and trust management. confidentiality_privacy_R3.pdf [Accessed: 8 May 2018]. Our goal is to develop an approach that enables humans to interact with automation more intuitively and naturally that is reusable across domains by modeling context and algorithms at a higher-level of abstraction. The URN standard, however, does not provide means of checking consistency between the GRL and UCM views, leading to models that are potentially erroneous. Blockchain being the decentralized technology with tamper proof data seems to be appropriate technology to fulfill the requirement of the health sector. This paper reviews the background and related studies in the areas of cloud systems, intrusion detection and blockchain applications against cyber attacks. Misconceptions and exaggerations about blockchain and its capabilities are pervasive in the media. We experimented with various values of threshold. University of Campinas, Brazil, 2018.
