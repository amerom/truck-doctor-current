A return circulation pipe is sometimes provided in a hot-water system where it is desirable to have hot water available continuously at the fixtures. Sort By. The disadvantages are than being very small, the pipes can easily become blocked due to internal sediment and the pump needs to overcome increased resistance when circulating the water from the boiler so the pump is more prone to wear. Alternatively, the pipework may feed into into the two ends of the radiators (as lower 2 radiators in the illustration).  The building uses solid floors it will not return back to the boiler heating.
