Configuring Wireless Band Preference on Client Devices Last updated; Save as PDF No headers. This is where band steering comes in. make sure that band steering is turned off on the meraki dashboard. By default, Band Steering is turned on. the band steering may be causing your particular wireless card to drop off 2.4Ghz and not connect to 5Ghz. With Band steering turn on, the smart plugs are unable to connect to the 2.4ghz network. Is this true? This reduces the number of probe responses on 2.4GHz by pushing clients to 5Ghz where supported. Recent experienced with band steering and Apple devices Looking for feedback on recent experience (within last few months) that you've had with band steering enabled and Apple devices. It's at the bottom of the access control page for the SSID. Depending on signal strength on the 5ghz band I'd recommend turning band steering off as the macs tend to get very flaky Band steering is a technique used in dual band WiFi equipment that encourages newer client devices to use the less congested 5 GHz network. Administrators can turn Band Steering on or off per SSID.  Band steering is a radio management technique Meraki APs use to improve capacity, throughput, and the experience for users of crowded wireless networks. Back when 802.11b was king. Channel selection and power settings on access points can be automatically optimized by Dashboard, or manually updated to meet specific requirements. If 2.4 GHz support is needed, it is recommended to use ' Dual-band with band steering' to ensure support for 2.4 GHz devices while dual band devices will be steered to use the 5 GHz band. In the early days of wireless LAN, 802.11b was king, and its kingdom was the 2.4 GHz band. – Posted by Hans Robertson Band Steering: When band steering is enabled, dual-band (2.4GHz and 5GHz) APs only reply to probe requests on the highest supported frequency band for the client. These devices will connect at faster speeds and more clients will be able to connect to the network simultaneously. Additionally, I have had a couple drops of both the Wemo light switches and my Amazon FireTV Sticks (2.4 & 5ghz) when band steering is enabled. The answer is found in band steering. I know this has historically been a huge issue with Apple devices on many AP's (not just Meraki). Here’s how it works. Meraki access points can now be configured to steer 5 GHz-capable wireless clients towards the 5 GHz band. Find out if band steering is a good way to get a better network connection. Based on the environmental factors it detects, Auto RF can automatically tune settings such as channel assignments, per-radio transmit power, and band steering. Heck the old unifi I replaced for a hotel client with MERAKI saw far fewer problems with macs and android devices when band steering was on. How can one turn it off? My Wemo Light Switches (2.4ghz) would not find the wifi when band steering was enabled. With it disabled they joined the network normally. Also, the Rogers installer advised me to keep band steering turned on as turning it off could affect TV performance. choose either both 2.4 and 5 or 5Ghz only. Auto RF is a feature on Meraki Access points that is built on Auto Tx Power and Auto Channel in order to detect non Wi-Fi interference and monitor the Wi-Fi environment. If you only have one network on your router, chances are that it is actually broadcasting on both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands and using a protocol called “band steering” to let your device switch automatically. Customers can either use Dual Band (with or without band steering), 5 GHz Only and 2.4 GHz at an SSID level.
