Comparing the expressions marked (1) and (2), we have: \[\begin{align}&a{x^3} + b{x^2} + cx + d = a\left( {{x^3} - S{x^2} + Tx - P} \right)\\&\Rightarrow \;\;\;{x^3} + \frac{b}{a}{x^2} + \frac{c}{a}x + \frac{d}{a} = {x^3} - S{x^2} + Tx - P\\&\Rightarrow \;\;\;\frac{b}{a} = - S,\;\frac{c}{a} = T,\;\frac{d}{a} = - P\\&\Rightarrow \;\;\;\left\{ \begin{gathered}S = - \frac{b}{a} = - \frac{{{\rm{coeff}}\;{\rm{of}}\;{x^2}}}{{{\rm{coeff}}\;{\rm{of}}\;{x^3}}}\\T = \frac{c}{a} = \frac{{{\rm{coeff}}\;{\rm{of}}\;x}}{{{\rm{coeff}}\;{\rm{of}}\;{x^3}}}\\P = - \frac{d}{a} = - \frac{{{\rm{constant}}}}{{{\rm{coeff}}\;{\rm{of}}\;{x^3}}}\end{gathered} \right.\end{align}\]. How to Find the Missing Value of Cubic Polynomial if Zeroes are Given : Here we are going to see, how to find the missing values of cubic polynomial if its zeroes are given. Example 1: Consider the following polynomial: \[p\left( x \right): 3{x^3} - 11{x^2} + 7x - 15\]. asked Jan 27, 2015 in TRIGONOMETRY by anonymous. Finding these zeroes, however, is much more of a challenge. Consider the following cubic polynomial: \[p\left( x \right):  a{x^2} + bx + cx + d\;\;\;\;...(1)\]. Now, let us multiply the three factors in the first expression, and write the polynomial in standard form. The polynomial can be up to fifth degree, so have five zeros at maximum. Use the rational zeros theorem to find all the real zeros of the polynomial function. Just as for quadratic functions, knowing the zeroes of a cubic makes graphing it much simpler. \[P =  - \frac{{{\rm{constant}}}}{{{\rm{coeff}}\;{\rm{of}}\;{x^3}}} =  - \frac{{\left( { - 15} \right)}}{3} = 5\]. input roots 1/2,4 and calculator will generate a polynomial ... Find a polynomial that has zeros $ 4, -2 $. Now, we make use of the following identity: \[\begin{array}{l}{\left( {\alpha  + \beta  + \gamma } \right)^2} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l}\left( {{\alpha ^2} + {\beta ^2} + {\gamma ^2}} \right) + \\2\left( {\alpha \beta  + \beta \gamma  + \alpha \gamma } \right)\end{array} \right.\\ \Rightarrow \;\;\;\;\,\;\;\;  {\left( 5 \right)^2} = {\alpha ^2} + {\beta ^2} + {\gamma ^2} + 2\left( 3 \right)\\ \Rightarrow \;\;\;\;\,\;\;\;  25 = {\alpha ^2} + {\beta ^2} + {\gamma ^2} + 6\\ \Rightarrow \;\;\;\;\,\;\;\;  {\alpha ^2} + {\beta ^2} + {\gamma ^2} = 19\end{array}\]. The solutions of this cubic equation are termed as the roots or zeros of the cubic equation. So the real roots are the x-values where p of x is equal to zero.
