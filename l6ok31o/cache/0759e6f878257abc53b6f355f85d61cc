Soft-rot fungi do not tend to be able to decompose matter as effectively as white-rot fungi: they are less aggressive decomposers. Larvae may take from 2-12 months to mature, depnding on temperature, humidity and food supply. In roof spaces, look for evidence of leaks that may promote fungal growth. Examples of soft-rot-causing fungi are Chaetomium, Ceratocystis, andKretzschmaria deusta. Attack in plywood that consist of centre veneers of untreated sapwood susceptible to powderpost attack often results in complete separations of the plywood. Adult beetles, larvae (inside timber) and eggs (laid in cracks and crevices). Hadrobregmus wood borer This borer is found in both hardwoods and softwoods but usually only those timbers that have been affected by moisture, wood rot or fungus. The exit or flight holes of the adult are generally the first signs that borers are present, often with a fine dust (frass) which is borer excrement. European house borer (Hylotrupes bajulus) is a destructive pest of seasoned coniferous timber including pine, fir and spruce. What type of borer was or is responsible?

The holes resemble that of a 3-inch size nail hole and are randomly spaced. Brown-rot fungi break down hemicellulose and cellulose. These hatch into the larval or grub stage, which burrow into the wood, producing a network of galleries which may considerably weaken the timber. Infested timber contains galleries packed with fine, powdery frass. Poor sub floor circulation can provide the perfect conditions for the growth of mould and fungi, and for termite infestation. CSIRO research has limited applications to domestic situations, and we don't conduct research into the control of common domestic pests such as termites or wood borers.

Adults develop from a pupal stage, burrow out of the wood and fly off to breed. This lyctid borer attacks the sapwood of susceptible hardwoods, but not softwoods. There are powder post beetles, European house borer and many more. Coatings such as paints, varnishes, waxes and oils are the principal means of controlling swelling, as well as protecting and enhancing timbers.

How to identify bronze birch borer and twolined chestnut borer Adults 1/4 to 1/2 inch long, slender, dark colored beetles. Common Signs: Holes vary in size and shape on the surface of the wood; ...

This lyctid borer attacks the sapwood of susceptible hardwoods, but not softwoods. Trees are the main target for the borers. The relative abundance of phenylpropane alkyl side chains of lignin characteristically decreases when decayed by white-rot fungi.
