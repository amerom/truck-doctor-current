Meloidogyne incognita, M. javanica, M. hapla and M. arenaria are of great significance for the reason of their wide spread distribution (Castagnone-Sereno, 2002). Spices M. incognita is an important pest of black pepper ( Piper nigrum ) in many countries particularly in Brazil and India where infestation levels of over 90% have been reported ( Koshy and Bridge, 1990 ). When M. incognita attacks the roots of plants, it sets up a feeding location, where it deforms the normal root cells and establishes giant cells. Yeates, G.W. Meloidogyne incognita (root-knot nematode - RKN), also known as the "southern root-nematode" or "cotton root-knot nematode" is a plant-parasitic roundworm in the family Heteroderidae.This nematode is one of the four commonest species worldwide and has numerous hosts.

Physical Description: The nematode Meloidogyne incognita, or more commonly known as the root knot nematode, is a plant parasite.Because it is a plant based parasite, it has a stylet that is hollow and protrusible. Jia SS. The name ‘root knot nematodes’ refers to the knots and swellings on plant roots which they cause. Root-Knot nematodes (RKN) are one of the most damaging groups of plant-parasitic nematodes capable of attacking a wide range of crop plants as well as many weed species. It typically incites large, usually irregular galls on roots as a result of parasitism. April 1994 Root-knot nematode species, including Meloidogyne incognita, are the most important of the plant parasitic nematodes, infecting almost all cultivated plants, and are responsible for billions of dollars in crop losses annually [1,2].They are obligatory sedentary endoparasites with a 1- to 2-month life cycle. Disclaimer: The Animal Diversity Web is an educational resource written largely by and for college students.ADW doesn't cover all species in the world, nor does it include all the latest scientific information about organisms we describe. Males remain slender just as the second stage juveniles which, after hatching, try to find a new host.

Meloidogyne incognita is a polyphagous plant-parasitic nematode that causes considerable yield loss in agricultural and horticultural crops. Losses of potatoes due to Meloidogyne species, mainly M. incognita and M. chitwoodi, are estimated at 25% or more (Mai et al., 1981). It attacks the roots by wrapping around them and destroying regular root cells to make its own giant cells. Free and Open Access to Biodiversity Data.
