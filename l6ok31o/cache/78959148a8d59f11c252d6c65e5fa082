He said he had no address, no vehicle, did not file a tax return, and did not receive mail. Christopher T. Knight is expected to plead guilty to burglaries and be admitted into the Co-Occuring Disorders Court in Kennebec County, which allows for counseling and rehabilitation. He was also ordered to attend a mental health program and submit to probation. He just vanished into the forest, with no idea of what he was doing or where he was going. Christopher didn’t always wander around the woods. Knight may have been the most successful burglar ever, as he committed about 1,000 burglaries without being caught over his 27-year period in the woods of Maine. Our mission is to bring our readers the most interesting and relevant lifestyle content from all around the world. “Everyone had a very strong opinion about Knight, and none of them had the same opinion,” Friedrich told me. Instead, he wanted to get away from people and enjoy solitude. He said that losing his identity was the ultimate freedom. Though he had a regular upbringing, he found it extremely difficult to connect with other people. Christopher Knight spent 27 years living in woods in Maine, becoming known as the North Pond Hermit after more than 1,000 burglaries, but â¦ For decades, the residents of Maine’s Kennebec Valley believed that the North Pond hermit was a myth. A burglar in the area began stealing all kinds of small items from local residents, and rumors of someone lurking in the woods led to nicknames such as the “North Pond Hermit” and even “the Mountain Main.” Some called the perpetrator of these stealthy crimes “the Hungry Man” because he never stole expensive items, instead choosing food, winter clothes, batteries, and other essentials. Hughes yelled for him to get on the ground and the man complied. Filmmaker Lena Friedrich decided that she had to learn more. There was no season that challenged Knight’s ability to survive like winter did. That was a whole other story. That meant he had been in the woods for an astonishing 27 years. 27 years of confusion awaited for the residents of North Pond, Maine, and surrounding communities, but they were unsuspecting in the beginning. Thomas is retired from the Michigan Department of State on June 30, 2017 after 40 years of election administration service, which included 36 years as Michiganâs Director of Elections. Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com. We want to hear what you think about this article. Christopher Knight, center, sat silently Monday during his graduation from the Co-Ocurring Disorders Court Program in Augusta. Judge Nancy Mills took a lenient approach because she didn’t think that Knight was likely to hurt anyone. He endured winter temperatures of 20 degrees below zero. He had very little knowledge of the wilderness and had put himself at serious risk by going out to the woods without a plan. “I tried to find characters who would provide personal layers of understanding to the enigma.”, One of those characters happened to be a man named Carrol who succeeded in guiding Friedrich through the dense woods to Knight’s secret campsite. According to societal records, he didnât exist. He breezed through a nine-month course there where he learned to install home and car alarms. Usually, this meant food. Then, in April 2013, a man was arrested in the deep woods of Maine. People tried to make sense of Knight by comparing him to Henry David Thoreau, who famously enjoyed getting away from civilization into nature.
