Injecting sodium bisulphate into the starfish is the most efficient measure in practice. Filamentous algae encrusting coral skeletons after A. planci predation, Collapsed coral skeletons after A. planci predation and storm, Starfish handled to avoid damaging it (spines on the underside are blunt), Starfish 'competing' for remaining live coral, Blue Acanthaster planci in Balicasag Island (Philippines), Acanthaster planci (Crown of thorns starfish) spines up close, Favia pallida (hard coral) with signs of bleaching or crown-of-thorns starfish damage.
