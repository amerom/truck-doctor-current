</html>";s:4:"text";s:15282:"When Samuel and the Sons of Adam performed the ritual, Tic—spurred on by Hanna— tapped into the power instead, and the spell failed spectacularly, turning the Sons to dust and collapsing the lodge. The most important element of the spell is the "blood tie" between Tic, Christina, and Titus, but since Christina foiled Ruby's attempt to get her blood, the blood tie isn't complete. "Full Circle" picks up right where "Rewind 1921" leaves off, with Tic (Jonathan Majors), Leti (Jurnee Smollett), Hippolyta (Aunjanue Ellis), and Montrose (Michael Kenneth Williams) racing to save Dee (Jada Harris) from the curse that was put on her several episodes prior. She then shows Dee a machine that we aren’t shown, but can hear. Christina Braithwite spends the entire season doing chicanery hoping to secure all of the ingredients she’ll need, including Tic’s magically-imbued blood, for her own attempt at gaining immortality. The deceased Titus proves to be the easier piece to procure — Leti and Tic perform a spell that temporarily resurrects him, only for Titus to promptly kill him again and cut out a chunk of skin. Hanna’s spell requires a connection to Titus and a living Braithwhite. 08:42. Tic, his father Montrose, friend-then-lover Letitia “Leti” Lewis, and her sister Ruby Baptiste become entangled with magic and the racist white folks who wield it. Ultimately, the only one who accompanies Tic on his final journey and doesn't realize that it's a one-way trip is Montrose, whose final, heartbreakingly optimistic words to his son are "See you on the other side. For the elusive and powerful Christina, Leti asks her sister Ruby (Wunmi Mosaku) to help, since she is closest to Christina due to their complicated physical relationship. He says he went to the future, which he describes as "chaotic," saying that "white folks were rioting." With no one to stop her, she succeeds as Tick’s energy is transferred to her and a spell is created. Since her death over a century before, Hanna has been perfecting a spell that will "save them all" — but at great personal cost for Tic. It begs the question of what exactly the white people that Tic saw were rioting about, and whether the group's actions at the end of "Full Circle" may actually turn out to be what leads to that chaotic future. Hattie explains to her that while Hanna bound the book out of fear, it will be up to Leti to overcome that fear and fix the mistakes of the past in order to create a better future for her son. Even with a time jump, the show could conceivably bring back much of the cast from season one through time travel, magic, flashbacks, or a mixture of all three. She was troubled by what she saw of his death, saying she'd "never seen anything like this in all of [her] encounters," and was desperate to know if it was destined to come true. Hippolyta draws Orynthia Blue (herself) and Asteri (Diana), which she says she’s able to do because she was taught by an artist Afua—a nod to artist Afua Richardson, who created Dee’s drawings for the show. "If we ain't walking toward an altar to sacrifice ourselves for something important," Dora muses she holds Tic, "What is our purpose?". She loves art, books, film, games, music, television, and writing. For the binding spell that Tic and Leti plan to use against Christina, the "body" piece of the puzzle requires a physical link between all three Braithwhites: Titus, Christina, and Tic. This strongly implies that Dee is the woman in the hood that Tic meets in the future, which explains how she knew who he was and why she was waiting by the portal with the book. The first two episodes of the season, and the finale of Lovecraft Country are adapted from one short story, “Lovecraft Country” in the book of the same name, by Matt Ruff. Although Lovecraft Country wraps up the stories of its main protagonist and antagonist pretty definitively by the end of its first season, the series still leaves the door wide open for a second run. Sadly, those hopes were dashed when Christina did exactly what she'd promised to do and killed Tic in order to perform her immortality spell. Although we spent an entire episode watching what happened to Hippolyta when she went through the time portal, we only ever get a couple sentences describing what happened to Tic. Lovecraft is to Lovecraft Country what Norse Mythology is to Marvel’s Thor. Tic is completely drained of his blood, the spell is successful, and Christina succeeds where the male Braitwhites failed, bringing the story, you guessed it…”Full Circle.”. Titus Braithwhite founded the Sons of Adam when he discovered the Book of Names, which is essentially a cypher for the Language of Adam, and functionally a book of spells. Although Tic's death was predicted numerous times throughout the series, most of the main characters, including Tic, seemed to hold out hope until the very end that he would somehow find a way to survive. The Sons of Adam are alchemist zealots dedicated to opening that gate, returning to Eden, and achieving immortality. Major spoilers for Lovecraft Country ahead. While Hattie teaches Leti the spell she'll have to perform in order to create that future, Tic learns from Hanna the full extent of her magical plans. Lovecraft Country flashes back to the Korean War and forward to Tic's future in episode 6. When Leti does the incantation it doesn’t work, so deus ex Ji-ah steps in, uses her tails (which she has sudden mastery over) to connect Tic and Christina together, and Leti continues to chant until the whole area explodes with magical energy. We see a brief flash of Dee resting her hand on the shoggoth's forehead as Tic watches over them, mirroring the interaction between Tic and the shoggoth in episode eight. The book turns out to be Lovecraft Country, written by Tic and Leti's son George, which — while it alters some of the details — narrates the story that Tic and his family are living out on the show, including how Tic will die during Christina's spell to become immortal. And when she realizes she can’t use magic, Leti tells her it’s not just her, it’s all white people. This is actually the same shoggoth that Tic and Montrose summoned in episode eight, "Jig-A-Bobo," when they cast a protection spell around Tic. After learning their destinies from Tic's ancestors, all of the couple's scenes in "Full Circle" are heavy with sadness, as if each of them serves as an unspoken goodbye.
