Meaning. It accounts for about 80% of all the bone mass in humans. It can be damaged when poor nutrient supply to ligaments fails to completely heal injuries. Haversian system and Volkmann's canals are absent. The human skeletal system, which serves as a framework for the human body, is primarily made up of two types of specialized connective tissues: bone and cartilage. Cartilage is a strong, flexible, fibrous tissue that forms rubber-like padding at the ends of long bones that help in the movement of bones. On the other hand, Cartilage is a stiff, flexible and connected tissue and mostly have their location on the larynx and ear. The human skeletal system consists of bones and cartilages of various types. Cartilage acts like a pad or cushion, protecting your bones at the joints during movement. Let’s have a deeper look. Even though the bones and cartilages are connective tissues and they are the components of the skeletal framework, both show considerable differences in their formation, organization and functions. They also work together with muscles to help in movement. A bone is a hard connective tissue of the body that have whitish tissue that completes the skeleton in humans and other vertebrates. The matrix consists of the protein called chondrin, and they are organic. What are the main structural differences between cartilage and bone? Based on the arranged and composition of the tissue, bones are formed of two different tissues; cortical bone and cancellous bone. A bone is a hard connective tissue of the body that have whitish tissue that completes the skeleton in humans and other vertebrates. Hyaline cartilages are translucent and shiny and are mostly found in ribs, joints, nose larynx and trachea. The matrix of cartilage is made up of glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, collagen  fibers and, sometimes, elastin. Bones: Cartilage Bone is a hard, inelastic and rigid tissue: Cartilage is a soft, elastic and flexible tissue: Bones are hollow, compact and are of different shapes: Cartilage is padlike and transparent: Bones have a very hard matrix due to calcium salts Cartilages have slightly flexible matrix due to a protein called chondrin. Cartilage is located in very specific places, usually between two bones. When this cartilage is damaged by trauma, disease or simply thins with age, bones can rub directly against each other, causing pain and inflammation, which can eventually result in … Cartilage acts as a cushion and reduces the friction between the bones and in some cases holds bones together, like rib cartilage. It grows and repairs slower than other connective tissues. Churchill Livingstone. Lacunae do not possess canaliculi, and each lacuna has two-three chondrocytes. The Main Difference Between Bone and Cartilage is that Both bones and cartilage are important parts or tissues of our body but differ greatly in terms of structure and function.Bone is strong and flexible connective tissue while cartilages are flexible connective tissue. In bones, matrix occurs in lamellae and are vascular. Elastic cartilage is more flexible than other cartilages and has more amount of elastin protein. Cartilage and bone are specialized connective tissues that provide support to other tissues and organs. The bones in the skull are mostly flat bones that are similar in composition to the long bones. Fibrocartilage is normally tough and it tends to occur at the site of fractures, disc, and joints. Cartilages consist of a glycoprotein called lubricin, which helps in bio-lubrication and protects the cartilage against wear and tear. Bones are mineralized tissues consisting of other types of tissues within them like the bone marrow, periosteum, endosteum, and blood vessels. They occur in lamellae and are vascular. The main difference between bone and cartilage is that bone is a hard and rigid tissue, whereas the cartilage is a soft, elastic and flexible tissue. Cartilage cells are known as chondrocytes. Besides, bone marrow is the site for blood cell formation. and also give a definite form and shape of the body. The bone structure is diminished due to a drop in bone density from osteoporosis. Bones cannot be bent Difference between Bone and Cartilage. Cartilage and synovial fluid. Bones are important parts of the body as they serve a lot of vital functions. Cartilage is soft except for calcified cartilage. They are mainly... Fibrocartilage is found in the knee and it is tough and inflexible. Once … Altogether, there are three different types of cartilages, namely: Hyaline cartilage: It serves as a shock absorber and allows the smooth movement of the bones at joints. As cartilage further deteriorates, adjacent bones may not have sufficient lubrication from the synovial fluid and cushioning from the cartilage. Bone – A complex structure consists of connective tissues that are hard and provide support, shape, and protection to the body. Cartilage is thin, avascular, flexible and resistant to compressive forces. Avoiding Hip Replacement. It is primarily found in the pinna of the ear. Cartilage is found in ear, nose, larynx and trachea. You can easily improve your search by specifying the number of letters in the answer. Cartilage is the simple structure, made up of connective tissue which is soft and are useful in providing flexibility to the joints and also protect from the external and internal shocks.

Every bone joint in your body has a cartilage, a flexible tissue that minimizes friction between the bones. Bone vs. Cartilage. It is very resilient and milky white glassy in appearance. It is also found in the joints, the rib cage, the ear, the nose, the throat and between the bones of the back. Answers (1) State three structural differences between biceps and muscles of the gut. Infections in the cartilage might lead to significant tissue damage and perichondritis in some cases. Articular cartilage is a complex and specialized tissue that provides a slick and bouncy cushion between bones at the joints. It’s held by a series of ligaments that go to the temporal bones of the skull, called the Styloid ligaments. Answer. They do not possess calcium salts. The cartilage is present in the ears, nose, and joints of the body, whereas bones make up the skeletal system of … Lacunae possess canaliculi where each lacuna consist of only one cell (osteocyte). (a) Name the bone (b) Name the type of the joint formed by the bone at its anterior end with the adjacent bone . These can show a decrease in the space between your discs, bone spurs (bony growths on your vertebrae), fractures, and other problems related to your bones. Cartilage is a flexible and strong type of connective tissues in most of the vertebrates usually as parts of their endoskeletons. Cartilage occurs where flexibility is required, while bone resists deformation. These structures exist in different shapes and sizes with different forms of complexities fit for different functions. Cartilage lacks blood supply except in some cartilage with no deposition of calcium salts. The growth of cartilage is unidirectional, i.e. While citing the basic difference between bone and cartilage; it can be mentioned that the bone is a hard connective tissue that forms the skeletal system of the body. Articular cartilage functions as a shock absorber and also reduces friction between bones where they meet at joints. Inside the cortical bones is the cancellous bone that is spongy and more flexible. Difference between Bone and Cartilage. In cartilages, the matrix is said to be as homogeneous mass without lamellae. Write the differences between bones and cartilage. These are active participants of blood supply. Bone tissues first appear in the 6th to 8th week of the embryo, and ossification of cartilage takes place. Articular cartilage is a complex and specialized tissue that provides a slick and bouncy cushion between bones at the joints. Hyaline cartilage which occurs mainly along the bronchial tubes, larynx, nose, and trachea. These cartilages are only present towards the anterior end of the ribs, providing medial extension. The cartilage in ears is the auricular cartilage that forms the outermost part of the ears (outer ear). The cells of bone are called osteocytes and the cells of cartilage are called chondrocytes. The skull is one of the most crucial parts of the skeleton in all vertebrates that provides a protective cage to the brain and some sense organs. Most of the joints in our body are lined with a thin layer of articular cartilage, made of collagen and chondroitin. For instance, cartilage is present in the joints between bones, rib cage, ear, nose, bronchial tubes, inter-vertebral discs, elbow, knee and ankle. We have 3 types of cartilage tissue: Hyaline cartilage is made of collagen and has a distinctive glassy appearance. Bone marrow is a kind of tissue from which all blood cells made. Besides, they also provide a site of attachment to the muscles. The extracellular matrix is composed of collagen fibers, elastins, and proteoglycans. It is found inside of joints and inside the respiratory system. It’s located at the level of the third vertebra, between the jaw and the thyroid cartilage. As mentioned before, hyaline cartilage contains a lot of collagen; it contains type II, specifically. Cartilage is non-porous and can be bent Cartilage does not have Haversian system and Volkman’s canals. Below are all possible answers to this clue ordered by its rank.  Cartilage is mostly prevalent in embryo stages where skeletons are initially built up of cartilages. At the proximal end, the head of the humerus joins with the glenoid cavity of the shoulder plate or scapula. The primary function of cartilage is to provide a smooth surface over which other tissues and move and glide easily. Bones are rigid, non-flexible, and robust. Elastic cartilage made of, you guessed it, elastic fibers. Difference Between Cartilage, Ligaments and Tendons. Bone vs. Cartilage. Cartilages are flexible, soft, and elastic. It can bend a bit, but resists stretching. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). (2004) Anatomy and Physiology. It is stiffer and less flexible than a muscle but not as hard and rigid as bones. As a person ages, this cartilage can wear away, leading to joint pain and swelling that is sometimes only alleviated by surgery. Bones grow in both directions (bidirectional). Bones replaces cartilage in fetal and childhood period. The diagram below represents a mammalian bone. Bones and cartilages are supporting connective tissues. Bone is highly vascularised, and its calcified matrix makes it very strong. Bone: Bone is a strong and nonflexible connective tissue. Type. Structure of Hyaline Cartilage. Cartilage also meet with some kind of disease and conditions which include Osteoarthritis where the cartilage gets thinned out and this in turn result in friction between bones, Costochondritis a condition where the cartilage in the ribs are inflamed leading to chest pain, a condition known as achondroplasia that leads to dwarfism. Key Difference: The main difference between bone and cartilage is that bone is a hard and rigid tissue, whereas the cartilage is a soft, elastic and flexible tissue. The chondrocytes are localized within lacunae and thus cannot move to the damaged areas. In the case of cartilaginous fish, the whole endoskeleton is made up of cartilages. A baby is full of this before the bones are totally formed. Additionally, it doesn’t articulate with any other bone. Articular cartilage is the hyaline cartilage that lies on the surface of bones. It is not as hard and rigid as bone, but it is much stiffer and much less flexible than muscle. When this cartilage is damaged by trauma, disease or simply thins with age, bones can rub directly against each other, causing pain and inflammation, which can eventually result in arthritis. The difference between bone and cartilage is that bone is hard while cartilage is soft. Cartilage occurs where flexibility is required, while bone resists deformation. Most red blood cells in adults are formed in the flat cells. Cartilage stops growing in late teens as chondrocytes stop dividing and regenerate poorly in adults. A common feature of middle to old age is the degeneration of the hip joint. It’s located at the level of the third vertebra, between the jaw and the thyroid cartilage. Cartilage acts as shock absorbers between two bones and they prevent the rubbing between them the bones. The specialized cells in cartilage are termed chondrocytes which divide to give rise to new cells. Cartilage is much softer, more pliable component that is mostly found in between the joints of the bones, the rib cage, the ear, the nose, the bronchial tubes and the intervertebral discs. The cranium covers the brain and different nerves, whereas the facial bones protect the sense organs and provide facial structure. Bones are hard as a result of the deposition of phosphates and carbonates of calcium in the matrix. Learn how your comment data is processed. Search and Filter. In the case of cartilaginous fish, the whole endoskeleton is made up of cartilages. Lacunae of cartilage do not have canaliculi, and each lacunae has 2-3 cells. Both are structural constituents of a human body. They are not the participants in blood supply, except in perichondrium. They provide support, surface for the attachment of muscles and protection to many vital organs like brain, heart, eyes etc. Furthermore, it’s … First is the fluid in the joint space – synovial fluid. Cartilages are part of connective tissues that also form a structural part of various organs like the ear and nose. Cartilage. Cartilage is a stiff but flexible connective tissue found in many parts of human and animal bodies. It is a bony structure, consisting of two parts; cranium and facial bones. Both bones and cartilages are involved in theformation of the skeletal system of vertebrates. Even though the bones and cartilages are connective tissues and they are the components of the skeletal framework, both show considerable differences in their formation, organization and functions. Thus, cartilage damage takes longer to heal. Difference between Bone and Cartilage Key Difference: The main difference between bone and cartilage is that bone is a hard and rigid tissue, whereas the cartilage is a soft, elastic and flexible tissue. It is also found in the joints, the rib cage, the ear, the nose, the throat and between the bones of the back. © 2020 Microbe Notes. The cartilage matrix may or may not have calcium salts. Articular cartilage is the hyaline cartilage that lies on the surface of bones. They have the deposit of calcium salts largely of calcium phosphate. Date posted: May 25, 2017. Both are made up of collagen, an extracellular matrix and the cells. A bone is a connective tissue where the living cells, tissues, and other components are enclosed within hard non-living intercellular material. Additionally, it doesn’t articulate with any other bone. Based on the number of different components in the cartilage, cartilages are of three types; hyaline cartilage, fibrocartilage, and elastic cartilage. Refer to the table below for a detailed difference between bone and cartilage. The division and growth of chondrocytes take place at a very slow rate, which is why they don’t increase much in size or mass. Cartilage: Cartilage is a flexible … 1. Articular cartilage is a complex and specialized tissue that provides a slick and bouncy cushion between bones at the joints. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below There are many differences between bone and cartilage. The two important constituents of bone are collagen and calcium phosphate that distinguish it from other similar structures like the enamel and chitin. Bone tissues in the hard structure form a honey-comb like a matrix internally composed of two different cells; osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Thus, this summarizes the difference between elastic cartilage and hyaline cartilage. Fifteenth Edition. Point of comparison: Bones: Cartilage: Meaning-complex structure consists of connective tissues – provide support, shape, and protection to the body.-consists of connective tissues-soft and provides flexibility to the joints -It protects the body from internal and external shocks. It’s held by a series of ligaments that go to the temporal bones of the skull, called the Styloid ligaments. What they actually are?
