Newfoundland and Labrador’s significant offshore oil deposits and production are what make the province a relevant comparator to Alberta’s oil sands. Cumulative royalties paid to the Governments of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador from 1997 to 2017 total quite $23.3 billion. ST. JOHN'S, N.L. Errors of fact made by the minister appear intended not to be reviewable by the Court. However, the second change worth noting is both much more subtle and potentially more impactful. P.O. The purpose of this report is to show how the oil and gas industry impacts the Newfoundland and Labrador economy and how potential growth in output in the years ahead could benefit the province. The 2017 Regulations apply to any leases in the offshore area issued after its coming into force on November 1, 2017. The sharp slowdown in energy production and the associated reduction in capital spending, together with measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, caused employment in Newfoundland and Labrador to fall by -25,000 jobs between February and May. Author(s):  St. John’s, NL Remedies available to proponents: With some exceptions, the remedies available to an applicant on judicial review are limited, and typically decisions are remitted back to a decision-maker, often with judicial guidance. Phone:1-709 729-4678 While the 2003 Regulations provided for a full airing of disputes, on facts and law, the cost associated with the resolution of disputes was generally high, with long timelines both at the arbitral stage and on appeal.             Simon C. Baines, Tommy Gelbman. Web: www.cnopb.nl.ca, Royalties Administration and Monitoring Division The changes to the regulations attempt to simplify some of the calculations and administration of offshore royalties in the Province. The Conference Board of Canada says Newfoundland and Labrador is expected to lead the country in economic growth, thanks to offshore oil royalties. — Newfoundland and Labrador will target big spending in health, education and by the Crown corporation overseeing the … The new regime contemplates what is anticipated to be a speedier and less costly process, before the Court, on relatively expedited timelines – but on narrower grounds of appeal. On December 6, 2001, an amendment was made to the Constitution of Canada to change the province's official name to Newfoundland and Labrador. Whether this outcome is realized remains to be seen, as sections 85 and 86 provide many opportunities for judicial scrutiny of ministerial decision-making. As all current development projects offshore Newfoundland and Labrador share in the utilization of transportation and transshipment assets (and it is reasonable to expect that some form of sharing will continue for any future offshore development projects), it will be helpful if all projects are subject to the same principles and provisions regarding the proper calculation of eligible transportation costs. 50 Elizabeth Avenue Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board Project proponents will want to carefully consider several changes in the 2017 Regulations: the elimination of the incremental royalty and its replacement with a net royalty, the removal of all arbitration provisions; and, an update to the transportation provisions to make them more consistent with corresponding provisions applicable to current offshore development projects. An ongoing battle between federal government and Newfoundland and Labrador over oil royalties resulted in the Canadian flag being removed from all provincial buildings in late 2004. Offshore operators pay royalties and taxes to the provincial government in the province in which they operate. While this is not likely to be a significant issue based on the existing commercial arrangements in place for transportation capacity, it could become more relevant if project proponents return to the early days of development offshore Newfoundland and Labrador where different proponents owned or time chartered transportation assets. While the 2017 Regulations make a number of changes relative to the 2003 Regulations (many of which we consider to be fairly inconsequential), we want to focus on the following three items that any project proponents will need to be aware of and will want to carefully consider going forward: However, while it is important to focus on the changes that have been made, it is also equally important to focus on one change that has not been made. Offshore oil royalties, normally worth well more than $1-billion annually to Newfoundland, is expected to be slashed in half this year. In summary, the 2017 Regulations introduce some significant changes that any proponent of a project subject to this new regime will want to carefully consider – particularly if that proponent is accustomed to a royalty regime under (or similar to) the 2003 Regulations. Newfoundland and Labrador lets oil companies claim decommissioning cost overruns against past royalties they have paid. Newfoundland and Labrador 2017 Fiscal Update 2 Marc Pinsonneault Newfoundland & Labrador ($ million) Budget Fall 2017/18 2017/18 Var. The Newfoundland and Labrador Oil and Gas Industries Association (Noia) was founded in 1977 to represent the supply and service sector of the offshore oil & gas industry. Natural Resources Building As a result, oil revenues are a significant portion of the Province’s total revenues. The new regulations remove all arbitration provisions. Canada A1B 4J6 However, in late November 2015, very shortly after the announcement of this new regime, the Liberal Party defeated the PCs. More than $506 million spent on research and development, and education and training. Specifically, the report will address: • The current economic impact of the offshore oil industry on the Newfoundland and Labrador economy, including: There was no year-by-year analysis to determine whether the $2.5 billion figure is exactly what Newfoundland and Labrador is owed in oil royalties. However, in this respect the 2017 Regulations give with one hand while taking with the other. Minister’s Office. Further, with the elimination of the return allowance, it seems likely that a project will be subject to net royalty under the 2017 Regulations earlier than the same project might have been subject to incremental royalty under the 2003 Regulations – particularly projects with very significant and front-end loaded capital costs, which is often the case with offshore development projects. Known as Hibernia, the oilfield is located on the Grand Banks in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin, about 315 km east of St. John's. [1] Pursuant to section 2, the Royalty Regulations, 2003 apply to any offshore leases issued after April 1, 1990. [2] Gross revenue continues to be net of eligible transportation costs.

Fortunately, section 33 of the PNG Act appears to continue to provide project proponents with an opportunity to discuss areas of concern with the Province in the hope of achieving a balance that would allow for a project to proceed (and to succeed), which is something that everyone interested in the Newfoundland and Labrador offshore area would dearly like to see happen sooner rather than later. First, as mentioned above, the 2017 Regulations eliminate all uplifts on eligible costs, including for the determination of eligible transportation costs. Oil & Gas. Stated simply, the 2017 Regulations have eliminated the periodic incremental royalty (both tier I and tier II) and have replaced it with a monthly net royalty.

Newfoundland and Labrador lets oil companies claim decommissioning cost overruns against past royalties they have paid. The transportation provisions in the 2017 Regulations are largely the same as currently apply to Hebron, Hibernia and Terra Nova, but unfortunately the Province has introduced some changes (and at least one significant change) that are likely to result in very different royalty consequences for new projects subject to the 2017 Regulations relative to these existing projects. Atlantic Petroleum Royalties: iv The oil and gas industry offers the first real opportunity in quite some time for Atlantic Canada to lift itself out of the cycle of debt and dependency in which we have been stuck for several generations. Current Projects Four oil projects produce offshore Newfoundland and Labrador: Hibernia, operated by Hibernia Management and Development Company Ltd. Terra Nova, operated by Suncor Energy White Rose, operated by Husky Energy Hebron, operated by ExxonMobil Canada Quick Facts $5.4 billion – in industry spending on exploration and development in 2016 $920 million – estimated payments to … $19.8 billion in cumulative royalties to the Provincial Government as of March 31, 2017 1.7 billion barrels of oil produced since 1997 (Source: Advance 2030: A Plan for Growth in the Newfoundland and Labrador Oil and Gas Industry ) Royalty Regulations, 2003 under the Petroleum and Natural Gas Act (O.C. Cumulative royalties paid to the Governments of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador from 1997 to 2017 total more than $23.3 billion. Oil workers discovered Newfoundland and Labrador's first commercial offshore oilfield in 1979 after about 13 years of exploratory drilling in offshore waters. In our view, these changes may impact future project proponents in respect of three particular issues: (i) access to justice and expediency in resolution of future disputes; (ii) the availability of judicial review and standard of review of ministerial decision-making; and (iii) remedies available to proponents that challenge ministerial decision-making.

The new regulations apply to all offshore leases issued after November 1, 2017. Newfoundland and Labrador first began producing oil in 1997 from the Hibernia Field. The net royalty created by the 2017 Regulations starts at 10% when the recovery factor equals 1.0 and rises to a maximum of 50% when the recovery factor is 3.0 or more. COVID-19 drop in oil prices has hobbled oil exports and energy investment. The 2007 Energy Plan stated that the government of Newfoundland and Labrador would take 10% equity in all future projects via Nalcor Energy (it is expected that Nalcor would take up its equity at the development plan approval stage and would negotiate payment of its share of exploration costs and pre-development costs incurred). We have built our reputation on our commitment to our clients' success and the experience, expertise and collaborative approach for which we are recognized. Industry, Energy and Technology This will help to eliminate irregularities and inefficiencies that might otherwise occur when multiple projects subject to different royalty regimes are making use of, and sharing the costs of, certain assets. Therefore a proponent may be more likely to have recourse to the Courts (with a speedier and less costly resolution), but the threshold grounds for relief appears intended to be higher (meaning fewer opportunities for appeal).

Known as Hibernia, the oilfield is located on the Grand Banks in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin, about 315 … the elimination of the incremental royalty and its replacement with a net royalty; an update to the transportation provisions to make them more consistent with corresponding provisions applicable to current offshore development projects. Under the 2017 Regulations, the province has changed the methodology for allocating transportation costs between multiple projects that share the use of a transportation asset (such as a shuttle tanker). Open this photo in gallery  Inherent in the calculation of the recovery factor of a project is one of the more significant changes under the 2017 Regulations – the elimination of the concept of return allowance, or the return on capital included as an element of the incremental royalty calculations under the 2003 Regulations and all other royalty regimes in effect for current development projects offshore Newfoundland and Labrador. Let us help you stay up to date. Given the massive capital costs associated with any offshore development project, we fully expect that project proponents will look to discuss the application of the 2017 Regulations to any future project subject to this regime in the same way that project proponents have discussed with the province the application of the 2003 Regulations to existing projects and opportunities. Natural Resources Building Simple concession-based fiscal regime. Receive updates by email. quite $506 million spent on research and development, and education and training. Differences in royalty treatment between projects using the same assets in a similar manner adds additional complexity and inefficiency to the commercial arrangements between project proponents, and often results in an additional transactional burden that all proponents must bear.
