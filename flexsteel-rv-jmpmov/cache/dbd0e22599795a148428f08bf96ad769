Product of it's two zeroes = 3 . Please follow these steps to file a notice: A physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf; Write the polynomial. Your proof more or less says that if both factors are non-zero, they have degrees $\ge 0$, and then the product polynomial can be seen to have the degree sum as its degree, and hence the product polynomial is non-zero as well. There are three given zeros of -2-3i, 5, 5. Hence, by a theorem due to Hurwitz (see, for example, Marden I949, p. 4) it is possible to number the zeros of polynomialsfk(z) such that lim akj =oj j1, 2, ...,m), (5) k--coo but that the remaining zeros Xkm+l' 0km+2 .

If none of the numbers in the list are zeros, then either the polynomial has no real zeros at all, or all of the real zeros are irrational numbers. Unlike other constant polynomials, its degree is not zero. f(x) = 3x-x-147x+ 49 The zeros are (Use a comma to separate answers… I N THIS TOPIC we will present the basics of drawing a graph. The sum will be since you add the two together, and the product will be because you multiply the two together. If α and β are zeros of any quadratic polynomial ax^2 + bx + c, then write the value of α + β and αβ. To determine zeros of , factorize the polynomial. Given , determine the sum and product of the zeros respectively. Solution: By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, since the degree of the polynomial is 4 the polynomial has 4 zeros if you count multiplicity. If the product of the zeros of a quadratic polynomial are `f(x)=x^2-4x+k` is 3 . Set each of the factorized components equal to zero and solve for .
