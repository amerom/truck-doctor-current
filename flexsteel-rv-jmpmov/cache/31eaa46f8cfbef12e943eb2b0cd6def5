Jamess laboratory research on sensation and perception was conducted in the first half of his career. The âMeâ is a separate individual a person refers to when talking about their personal experiences. William Jamesâ contributions to the field of psychology run unparalleled to most other players in this field. During an extended stay in Germany after graduating, James developed an interest in studying the mind, as well as the body. He also experienced neurasthenia, a medical condition characterized by fatigue, headache, and irritability, and endured periods of depression. Taylor, E. (2010). James classifies philosophers according to their temperaments, distinguishing between tough-minded â those who are empirical, materialistic, pessimistic, irreligious, and skeptical â and tender-minded â those who are rationalistic, intellectualistic, optimistic, religious, and assertive (Goodman, 2009; James, 1907). Psychological Problems It will be unnecessary for us here to touch upon James's treat ment of the ordinary problems of scientific psychology?as of the emotions, and the relational elements in consciousness ? William James was a leading figure in both psychology and philosophy at the turn of the 19th century, whose contributions laid the groundwork for many modern philosophers and behavioral psychologists. A look at the early development of modern psychology, however, reveals various figures who accepted a spiritual and collective dimension of the psyche, among them William James. For example, if a man murders his wife, we can either adopt a deterministic approach which holds that his actions were just âsupposed to be that way,â or we can adopt an indeterministic approach, viewing his actions to be motivated by his own will, thus allowing us to recognize the evil in the individual and inflict the necessary punishment (James 1896; Pomerlou, 2014). Together, these aspects form the self â the conscious entity capable of experiencing physiological responses, emotions, and thoughts. In addition to being a theorist and publishing many books, James was also a highly-esteemed professor at Harvard University and was the first to teach a psychology course in the United States. Functionalism formed as a reaction to structuralism and denied the value of introspection. A 'river' or a 'stream' are the metaphors by which it is most naturally describedâ (James, 1890). James himself remained unconvinced that psychology was in fact a distinct discipline, writing in his 1892 survey of the field, Psychology: Briefer Course,  "This is no science; it is only the hope of a science" (p. 335). We have evolved to be conscious beings because we would otherwise cease to exist. That is, under certain circumstances, we have the right to believe that future, unknown outcomes will occur, so as to help bring about those outcomes. During his time as a Harvard faculty member, James not only taught courses, but he also conducted laboratory research on sensation and perception during the first half of his career. Inspired by evolutionary theory, James’s theoretical perspective on psychology came to be known as functionalism, which sought causal relationships between internal states and external behaviors. William James, father of American Psychology, used functionalist perspective and acknowledged the survival importance of instinctive motivation. For example, we act differently when at work as opposed to when out with friends, as do we when talking to our boss as opposed to a coworker. On the other hand, the âIâ is the part of the self that knows who they are and what they have accomplished in life (Pomerleau, 2014). James started as an artist, then pursued medical studies. James theorized that behavior was driven by a number of instincts, which aid survival (Figure 1). HMH. 2. Freedheim, D. K. (2010). Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy. A history of modern psychology.  I. William James biography and contributions to psychology. In 1870, William James and Charles Sanders Pierce founded the school of American Pragmatism (Hookway, 2008). After his retirement in 1907, James continued to be engaged in the world of academia, publishing Pragmatism: A new name for old ways of thinking (James, 1907) among others, detailing the philosophical underpinnings of pragmatism as well as his philosophical stance on truth, knowledge, reality, and religion. 1. Together, they formulated the well-known James-Lange theory of emotion, which explains that emotion is the perception that the mind has of the physiological conditions that arise from a certain stimulus. The principles of psychology William James (1890). James then moved away from experimental psychology to produce more philosophical works (he is credited as one of the founders of the school of American Pragmatism), although he continued to teach psychology until he retired from Harvard in 1907.
