Regular removal of leaves and brush from residential and commercial properties is not considered a best management practice. All levels of government can take steps to reduce their enormous carbon footprint, For example, in the U.S., the federal government is the single biggest consumer of energy, with 360,000 buildings, 650,000 vehicles, and $445 billion spent annually on goods and services. Drop unreasonable barriers to solar power development. Switching government fleets to alternative fuel vehicles like EVs, and encouraging citizens and businesses to do the same, is an emerging area of local climate action. States and cities wield real power over the emissions released within their borders, including from cars, power plants, factories, and buildings. Based on an index that ranks every census tract according to income level, ethnicity, and pollution levels, it’s an innovative attempt to solve emissions and equity issues together. And the City of Los Angeles has approximately 11,000 vehicles and pieces of equipment. ), Construct and maintain more walkways, bike lanes, bike parking spaces. Focusing on adaption over mitigation can have … California’s Climate Change Scoping Plan encourages local governments to adopt goals to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 15% below 1990's levels by 2020, 40% below 1990 levels in 2030, and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. So far, Blue Acres has bought up more than 700 homes in 16 communities across nine counties. Here are a few: – Strategically planted trees reduce energy use by shading buildings and pavement in summer and blocking cold winds in winter. Amended last year, it requires all new residential construction from 2020 to be net-zero energy, meaning a building makes as much electricity as it consumes. Measuring, reporting and offsetting emissions. Reducing these emissions, which account for roughly 40 percent of our national output, involves moving from fossil-fuel energy to renewable electricity—think replacing gas-powered heating and hot-water systems with high-efficiency electric heat pumps—as well as using high-efficiency appliances and sealing up energy-sucking leaks. Bald Eagle. That’s the focus of this companion two-part series. Tony Evers ordered the creation of a task force to analyze Wisconsin's "climate crisis." It is often done to maintain a certain subjective aesthetic. More funding for land or conservation easements. – Making better use of existing infrastructure and lowering cost of public services, such as transit, sidewalks, water and sewer, schools, and public safety. Leading and championing policy to deal with the impacts of climate change is a key policy priority for LGNZ and its 78 member councils. Photo: Howard Arndt/Audubon Photography Awards, Great Egret.  The law establishes a working group—made up of environmental justice advocates and staff from the Departments of Health and Labor, among others—to ensure disadvantaged groups have access to resources like solar panels and energy-efficiency upgrades. But smarter agricultural practices could turn cropland into a carbon sponge. Cooperation on Mitigation Measures to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions - PDF. Climate Change Climate change affects all of us. A wide variety of organizations (federal, state, local, multilateral, private and nongovernmental) are addressing the implications of climate change globally. It aims to help identify and quantify the opportunities and risks that climate change pose for councils’ functions, responsibilities and infrastructure. On Wednesday, the task force delivered a 120-page report with 55 policy Climate Change Policy. An urban forest consists of the vegetation within a city, town, or suburb – including the trees, shrubs, grasses (and other groundcovers) along roads and in yards and parks. Can This Critically Endangered Bird Survive Australia's New Climate Reality? We’ve surveyed over 3,000 local election candidates for their policy positions on a range of topics, from climate change to rates. Increased funding for enforcement would result in higher compliance, and therefore lower greenhouse gas emissions. In 1988 the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) set up the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an expert body that would assess scientific information on climate change. They’re also looking beyond slashing emissions, creating innovative programs to help humans and wildlife adapt to the changes already upon us, and those to come. Who’s a Pioneer: Transportation is California’s largest source of emissions—more than 40 percent. Type in your search and hit Enter on desktop or hit Go on mobile device, Two-thirds of North American bird species are at risk of extinction from climate change. Are the Trump Administration's Environmental Rollbacks Built to Last? It’s the least you can do.

Those people, and the economies they support, are increasingly at risk from sea-level rise, storm surges, erosion, flooding, and saltwater intrusion into aquifers. The following are some key resources that may be useful to local governments regarding slowing the process of climate change, adapting to it, and addressing its impacts. Plants naturally pull carbon out of the air through photosynthesis; increasing soil health with compost and other practices enables plants to draw down even more of the gas, some of which they inject via their roots into the soil, where microorganisms consume it. And in 2021 New York City will become the first U.S. city to employ congestion pricing, charging drivers to enter much of Manhattan, which could raise $15 billion for mass transit upgrades by 2024. The code, which requires solar panels as well as higher-efficiency insulation and windows, also has requirements for new commercial construction and retrofits of existing commercial and state buildings. – Perpetuate and foster the growth of healthy forest; Effective climate action plans require that residents, public officials, businesses and other stakeholders cultivate trusting working relationships with one another. Infill development (i.e., new construction on vacant or underused lots in established neighborhoods or business districts) can have many benefits, but often only with local government encouragement or assistance. And Boulder, Colorado, where natural gas accounts for roughly a fifth of emissions, has pledged to reduce residential use by 85 percent by midcentury (and commercial and industrial use by 35 percent), largely by replacing gas-powered heating systems with electric pumps. (See energy.gov/savings for rebates available in your state. In theory, they can simply y, walk, or swim to new habitat. Climate.gov - A NOAA site that provides science and information for a climate-smart nation US Global Change Research Program - Established to assist the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.

U, “The views expressed in user comments do not reflect the views of Audubon. Other Leaders: Washington state is launching a similar program, and Colorado recently passed a series of laws aimed at increasing infrastructure for electric vehicles. Landfilled food waste results in the creation of methane; incinerating that waste lowers incinerator efficiency because of the high water content of food waste. 1. Gas-powered leaf blowers emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases. New Mexico is the first state to pass connectivity legislation. A March 2019 five-part series addressed actions individual people can take to reduce their carbon footprint on the road, in and around their homes, and in their diets. The following list of governmental actions, based on science and common sense, is by no means exhaustive. Although renewables now account for more than 17 percent of the nation’s electricity generation, coal and natural gas together represent more than three times that. Who’s a Pioneer: Armed with $40 million from a federal disaster-resistance competition, Louisiana rolled out an innovative initiative in which residents from six parishes designed coastal-resiliency projects. Taxpayers, of course, will have to be supportive when government leaders want to retrofit old government buildings to make them more energy efficient or upgrade vehicle fleets to more fuel-efficient, but initially more costly models. Christian Parenti, an investigative journalist and contributing editor for The Nation magazine, has written that a single action â replacing U.S. It also reduces the need for synthetic fertilizers (which contribute to both global warming and marine dead zones) and pesticides, safeguarding our food supply in the process. Why We Need It: Coastal counties are home to  42 percent of the U.S. population and contribute nearly half of the national GDP. It permanently limits uses of the land in order to protect its conservation value. To chart a course towards low-carbon communities, many U.S. cities have developed climate action plans and set greenhouse gas emissions reduction … But it went even further with the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, requiring at least 35 percent of clean-energy investments be made in marginalized communities, which are often burdened with pollution from power plants. Photo: Dick Dickinson/Audubon Photography Awards. Use best green technologies and practices for procurement and infrastructure upgrades. They also create noise and air pollution.

Your support helps secure a future for birds at risk. Why We Need It: Growing food accounts for nearly 10 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Landowners retain many of their rights, including the right to own and use the land, sell it, or pass it on to heirs. Ahwahnee Principles for Climate Change. Resources used by the author to research and write this post. Many might be able to minimize driving and flying while still accomplishing objectives of their positions. Errata. While the cost of solar and wind power, as well as battery storage, was once an obstacle, those costs have dropped dramatically over the past decade; since 2007, installed renewable energy capacity has more than doubled. Other Leaders: Washington governor Jay Inslee introduced legislation to invest nearly $80 million in net-zero buildings. After that, the author plans to address a range of private sector (manufacturing, agriculture, services) actions needed to help prevent the most devastating impacts of climate change. Securing a healthy and prosperous future. With less use of leaf blowers, roads and parking areas won’t be completely free of very small bits of debris, but there will be less dust and dirt in the air and less movement of this material into parked cars, screen porches, and open windows. Reporting on greenhouse gas emissions. Other states have prohibited non-utilities from selling solar-generated power directly to consumers. From Audubon Magazine How State and Local Governments Are Leading the Way on Climate Policy With the federal government failing to act, many states and cities are taking it upon themselves to cut emissions and increase resiliency.
