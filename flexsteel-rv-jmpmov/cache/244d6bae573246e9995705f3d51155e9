An 18-year study of Kenya's coral reefs has found that overfished reef systems have more sea urchins -- organisms that in turn eat coral algae that build tropical reef systems. How did the lack of sea urchins change the effect of lionfish on the reef? Predict: How do you think the reef will react to a lionfish invasion if there are no sea urchins? The results of long-term studies (2003–2015) of the reproductive biology of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus intermedius in wild populations located in the northwestern Sea of Japan along 400 km of the coast of the Primorye region of Russia and differing by the level of anthropogenic pressure are reported.

A sea urchin’s shell is called a test or a shell. Because they are easily studied, urchin eggs and sperm provide valuable information on fertilization and development that applies to many organisms, from jelly fish to humans. On the CONDITIONS tab, select Disease. B. On the CONDITIONS tab, select Disease. Predict: How do you think the reef will react to a lionfish invasion if there are no sea urchins? How lionfish will affect native fish populations and commercial fishing industries has yet to be determined, but invasive species generally have a very big negative impact on native ecosystems and local fishing economies. <p>Sea urchins are small, spike-covered sea creatures that live in oceans throughout the world.
