Where Lynch’s last decade of Hollywood death traps obsessively investigate the narcissistic seduction of the dream screen’s ensnaring identity-splintering illusionism by splintering the narrative itself — forcing viewers to question the very ontology of the cinematic experience — Weerasethakul similarly flips worlds inside out in order to reincarnate his quotidian wanderers into their possible magical ideals. Mysterious Object at Noon goes off on its own collaboratively developed tangent to trace the connections between real conditions and fantasy; Tropical Malady feigns a projector malfunction to disrupt its coherent love story, only to resume with the same actors in different but related guises.

After the anomalous action-musical spoof The Adventures of Iron Pussy (unreleased and rarely screened here), co-directed with friend Michael Shaowanasai, and several shorts, Weerasethakul made his greatest triumph to date, Tropical Malady, about two gay lovers whose story becomes — or in the second half of the film is retold as — a metamorphic folktale featuring haunted forests and possessed tigers.

Then came 2002’s Blissfully Yours, a true original that uses elements of the back-to-nature romance to sexually and atmospherically subversive effect.
