Powers large-scale data processing in the TF libraries below. Running Pipeline. Direct Runner to run on the host machine, which is used for testing purposes. This has been tested with dataflow Runner and Direct runner. Apache Beam provides a portable API layer for building sophisticated data-parallel processing pipelines that may be executed across a diversity of execution engines, or runners.The core concepts of this layer are based upon the Beam Model (formerly referred to as the Dataflow Model), and implemented to varying degrees in each Beam runner.

The direct runner is meant to be used for local debugging and testing your pipeline on small amounts of data. But avoid …. Several of the TFX libraries use Beam for running tasks, which enables a high degree of scalability across compute clusters. Instead of focusing on efficient pipeline execution, the Direct Runner performs additional checks to ensure that users do not rely on semantics that are not guaranteed by the model.

Beam Flink pipeline engine: this configuration runs pipelines on Apache Flink over Apache Beam. Get some concrete examples of data processing jobs in Apache Beam and learn about use cases of batch processing with Apache Beam. Commit 1 adds a ParDo test that hangs the direct runner as described in BEAM-3806. Local execution is limited by the memory available in your local environment. IM: I would recommend first getting familiar with the Beam model and terminology, read both Streaming 101 and 102, try to catch one of the Beam presentations, then try to run the examples and beam-samples that JB mentioned, and of course to play first with the direct runner before moving into the distributed runners.
