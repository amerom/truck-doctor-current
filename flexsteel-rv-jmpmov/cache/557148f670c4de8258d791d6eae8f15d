Protecting it, therefore, is a major challenge for the Association as it goes forward. That problem has been solved and most are now coming in at .75 or higher. American beekeepers have been using Italian honey bees (Apis mellifera ligustica) since they were first imported to the New World in 1859.The standard German honey bee (A. m. mellifera), which had been in America for more than 200 years, was by that time ill-tempered, disease-ridden, and less suited for honey bee management.Conversely, the Italian bees were and are excellent honey … If you are a beekeeper, then you know the dreaded Varroa Mite. These latter two (main) factors determine the best colonies from a member’s two lines from which samples are collected and shipped to the lab for DNA testing. In 2000, scientists began testing all 6 types of Russian bees (as they are called here) in the Province of Ontario, Canada. Carl served as president of the Georgia Beekeepers association and cooperated with the University of Georgia on its first Varroa mite threshold study, comparing, Russian bees with other Stocks in 2004 and 2005. It is important to understand that the Baton Rouge Laboratory does not actually “certify” stock according to Drs. Only 12 people have been able to do this.”. PO Box 2520, Marion, NC 28752, US (828) 652-3524 . The Association evaluates about 800 or more colonies each year, selecting about 90 queens based on mite growth and honey production. It also demands experience in managing Russian bees, which are known to be quite different than the run-of-the-mill Italian honey bee that mostly makes up the U.S. honey bee population. Currently President of the RHBA, he serves as a board member for two national bee industry organizations, as well as the U.S. Beekeeping Industry representative to the EPA’s Pesticide Program Dialogue Committee. Carl Webb of Clarkesville, Georgia began keeping bees in 1959 and maintained his activity while living throughout Europe, Africa and the United States. We will take a brief look at the differences between these two bees. The information included in this report has been gleaned from a number of sources, including printed references and personal interviews. Some prominent members of the Association are: Coy’s Honey Farm Inc., Jonesboro, Arkansas, which  began in 1969 when grandfather Gene Coy brought 12 hives. They clarified the situation this way: The  RHBA’s  board of directors decides who is or is not certified, according to current President Steven Coy. Russian Honey Bee Earning Its Stripes An adult female Varroa mite feeds on a developing bee. More than 25 years of research by the USDA Baton Rouge Bee Lab, as well as others, have proven that Russian bees are resistant to mites. Russian Honey Bee Publications Meet Each of the Members! Honey bee on composite flower. Virginia and her husband are gold medal honey producers from Clarksville, GA. However, according to Dr. Rinderer, neither of these determinations were published. Dan Conlon President 2 S. Mill River Rd. The presence of mites in our hives are so low year round that often times we don’t find a single mite during testing (Go Russians! Some lines will never be released to the public. The Russian Honey Bee is More resistant to Varroa Mites. USDA/ARS does not certify any bee stock especially Russian bees. The Bee Store will be offering Pure Russian Nucleus Colonies (Nucs) starting 1 … Steven Coy was one of the original members of the RHBA and did not have to jump through many hoops in the beginning. This opportunity has been provided to a great extent by the vision and effort of the USDA Agricultural Research Service, which continues to do the testing. No scheduled queen replacement (half of queens are two years old or older), No feeding of sugar in any form (except for queen rearing and starter nuclei). “They’re perfectly suited for Wisconsin, especially Washington Island, because we’re at the 48th longitudinal parallel replicating that indigenous area of Primorsky.” There’s a very limited supply in the United States with only 15 Russian bee breeders according to Dompke, concluding: “If you’re purchasing Russian honey bees and you haven’t purchased them from a Russian bee breeder, they’re probably not 100% Russian.”. I have even shipped queens to the country of Jordan for a research project. Our bees collect nectar from Cotton, Soybean, and Wildflowers while also pollinating Cucurbits in Northeast Arkansas and the Delta Region of Mississippi. Membership of the RHBA ranges from large commercial pollinators to smaller outfits selling honey and queens. Additionally, the entire outfit must be made up of Russian stock or be moving rapidly toward that goal. Use traditional breeding techniques to develop RHB with improved economic traits. Find more Russian words at wordhippo.com! Unfortunately, many breeders who are not certified members of the RHBA are marketing “Russian bees,” potentially damaging the brand. Certified in May 2012, Harry has built up his hive count from 70 to 200 hives, which is what the Association requires of members. FREE Shipping on orders over $150. Fifty to 60 of those are sent for DNA testing and those that pass are then used as breeders. Breeding, Genetics, Stock Improvement and Management of Russian Honey Bees for Mite and Small Hive Beetle Control and Pollination, Research project Number: 6413-21000-012-00), began Oct 01, 2008, under the leadership of Dr. Tom Rinderer, then leader of the Baton Rouge laboratory. Russian bees are mite resistant. He has a BS in Forestry and studied for both a masters degree in government administration at George Washington University and an MBA at Georgia State University. Develop procedures for routine identification of sex alleles and determine queen relationships in multiple queen colonies. of bees, which includes nurse bees, forager bees, guard bees, and drone bees. Coy’s is currently the only large, migratory outfit to move to Russian stock. He and Dr. F. Ruttner both concluded that the actual subspecies being brought to Louisiana and quarantined on a nearby island was Apis mellifera macedonica, a relative of the Carniolan bee (Apis mellifera carnica). He is not migratory, but sells honey to the public, as well as queens to other beekeepers through his operation. That they are generally tolerant to both Varroa and small hive beetle, however, is a big selling point. There are some strains of honey bees that are resistant to varroa mite. There, in addition to … However they are private and cannot be shared with non-members because they contain privileged information on specific lines. Russian honey bees have an innate resistance to various parasitic mites. Russian bee enthusiasts claim that they are gentle (not prone to sting), use less propolis than typical Italian honey bees, show winter hardiness (they hibernate in small winter clusters), produce a high nectar haul per bee, are more apt to building queen cells throughout the brood season, and may have a higher tendency to swarm. As the reputation of the Russian bee becomes more pronounced, the demand for these queens continues to increase. Carl Webb is a much smaller beekeeper than Coy’s Honey Farms. Russian Honey Bees; Resistance to Varroa in Russia; Importation of Russian Honey Bees; Evaluating the Russian Bee; Evidence of Varroa Resistance of Russian Bees; Multi-State Field Trials of Russian Honey Bees; Multi-State Field Trials of Russian Honey Bees: Honey Production; Multi-State Field Trials of Russian Honey Bees: Tracheal Mites In the winter of 2000 – 2001, there were heavy Winter losses of non-Russian hives. Many of them beg me to ship them queens. In 2008, the Russian Honey Bee Breeders Association (RHBA) was created with the following goal: The long-term objective of this project is to develop the economic value of Russian honey bees (RHB) through genetic improvements and devise innovative management strategies to increase the stock’s general and pollinating productivity. Harry Fulton, center with frame, teaching beekeepers. Some are only interested in maintaining the stock for their current and future use, producing honey and pollinating, while others aspire to become queen producers. Russian Honey Bee Publications "The primary purpose of the corporation will be to maintain and improve the genetic lines of Russian honey bees through propagation and selective breeding." However, they contribute to the genetic diversity of the stock and its disease resistance. They are not mite proof. Our bees are sourced from Richland Honey Bees, a member of the RHBA, and are certified pure Russian. So bear with us as we work in our business to rear a better Russian Bee. Email. South Deerfield, MA 01373 warmcolors@verizon.net David Coy/Coy's Honey Farm, Inc Vice President 4595 Co. Rt 745 Jonesboro, AR 72401 970 East Wire Rd Perkinston, MS 39573 Thus, it is important to understand that customers buying a Russian queen are not simply buying from a specific line, which is not revealed, but instead purchasing the results of multiple years of selection from the best mite resistant and highest honey producing queens available from all certified members.”, Each prospective member is issued a detailed manual, which provides a good many criteria for certification. However, 52 Russian hives were checked in the Spring of 2001, resulting in few losses. He repeated this in August of 2016 with two more treatments spaced apart. Recently, Steven Coy started  Coy Bee Company, LLC so that he can focus on producing Russian queens for distribution to the beekeeping public. Russia isn’t the only European nation to have seen massive honey bee die-offs this year: Officials have sounded concerns in France, too. All beekeepers should be cheering them on. At the moment, ill-perceived behavioral differences may actually keep demand down. Members. In “An Evaluation of ARS Russian Honey Bees…” There have been numerous studies of Russian honey bee resistance to varroa mites. The stated goal is to maintain and improve the genetic lines of Russian honey bees through propagation and selective breeding. He is two-time president of Apiary Inspectors of America and was Secretary-Treasurer of the Mississippi Beekeepers Association for 35 years. Honey bee stock was brought by the USDA to the U.S. The purpose of this article is to look more closely at this association, and attempt to make some conclusions about its possible future.
