</html>";s:4:"text";s:32872:"You can fire form 270 brass or use the slightly shorter 30-06 case and 220 round nose bullets seated shallow to approximate the length of the 30-03. Had Winchester used a longer case that was actually capable of delivering that sort of performance in the real world, or established more realistic performance objectives for the shorter case from the beginning, hunters very likely would not have encountered problems with squib loads and there would have been no reason to develop improved cartridges like the .458 Lott. Over the course of their expedition, the two men took over 500 animals, to include a number of lion, elephant, rhino, and buffalo in addition to hundreds of antelope. Trawling in Alaska – Serious Issue or Responsible Business? Cartridge Type: Height: 2.583" Width: 0.543" Average FPS: 2200 … I would talk to Kirk and be sure that I was getting a barrel that is compatible with .408 bullets if I went with a 405 Winchester chambering. But, the 45/70 ballistics makes for a tough comparison with the .405 ballistics. While the .458 Winchester Magnum has a pretty stout recoil itself, the .458 Lott has considerably more. 405 Winchester Dr , Franklin, TN 37069-7100 is currently not for sale. This surge in the popularity of African hunting safaris among American hunters was helped along by writers like Jack O’Connor and Robert Ruark (though they were far from the only ones). Again, no substituent exists for proper bullet placement. However, the .458 Lott is generally better suited to using heavier bullets. Also developed using a necked up .375 H&H case, the .458 Lott is very similar to the .458 Win Mag, but the primary difference is the .458 Lott use a .3″ longer case (2.8″ vs 2.5″). Thanks Lyle from Australia. In the 1890s, Winchester made two types of center-fire rifles: classic lever action guns that used fat, low-velocity bullets, and the single shot 1885 series low/high walls that fired larger rounds. Just about all of those bullets previously mentioned as available in factory ammunition are also usually available as component bullets. Happy hunting! The Lyman 50th Edition (p369-370) and Hornady 10th Edition (p767-769, 770-771) reloading manuals as well as Kevin Robertson’s book Africa’s Most Dangerous (p114-115) were used as references for the history of the cartridges. However, certain parts of Africa mandated the use of a .40 caliber cartridge or larger for dangerous game at the time, thus limiting the utility of those Weatherby cartridges. The Winchester model 1895 was the last lever-action designed by legendary firearms designer John Browning, and the first Winchester lever gun to utilize a box magazine instead of the then-universal tubular magazine. .458 Win Mag rifles in current production include the Winchester Model 70, CZ 550, and Blaser R8. Not only did untold numbers of American hunters journey to Africa armed with Model 70 rifles chambered in the new cartridge, but many African Professional Hunters and game rangers began using the cartridge as well. I used ShootersCalculator.com to compare trajectory and recoil for the cartridges. 405 Win 300 gr InterLock® SP Item #8241 | 20/Box . .458 Lott vs .458 Win Mag Ammo . Glad you enjoyed it Mark! Regardless of how well a given person handles recoil, all other things being equal, they will absolutely shoot better with a milder recoil. In that same vein, the .458 Winchester is generally better suited to using lighter weight bullets with a lower sectional density. So, adding a scope, sling, etc. Most of the big retailers in the USA will usually have a couple of boxes of each on hand, but outside of places like Alaska (and often not even there), it would be extremely unusual to find .458 Winchester or .458 Lott ammo at a Wal-Mart or a smaller gun store. With all of those things in mind, Winchester sensed an immense opportunity and stepped in to fill that void with the cartridge we now know as the .458 Winchester Magnum in 1956. A properly fitted stock with a recoil pad will tame felt recoil to a certain extent. The cartridge has no trouble pushing a 500 grain bullet at 2,150 feet per second with ample space remaining in the case, so there’s no need to compress the powder charge or glue the bullets in place. Like we just discussed though, that extra power comes at the expense of more recoil. SUBSCRIBE. McCann Industries even manufactured a .458 Win Mag M1 Garand for a short period of time as well. That alone will reduce free recoil energy by about 5% for the .458 Lott in this particular case. Very interesting article and comparison of the Magnum and the Lott. The 6,604 sq. All other things equal, a heavier projectile of a given caliber will be longer and therefore have a higher sectional density and consequently penetrate deeper than projectiles with a lower mass and sectional density. Millions of successful hunts have proven the accuracy and deadly effect of the famous Hornady ® InterLock, ® SST, ® InterBond ® and GMX ® bullets we load into Hornady ® Custom™ rifle ammunition.. Every round of Hornady ® Custom™ ammunition is hand inspected … The .458 Winchester Magnum has a smaller case than the .458 Lott and therefore has a lower ceiling on its maximum performance. Just like the 9mm Luger vs. .45 Auto, M-14 vs. M-16 rifle, .300 Savage vs. .35 Remington, or perhaps even .30-30 Winchester vs. .32 Winchester Special. Though I’m not aware of any 480 grain factory loads, that’s another good option for handloaders. Regardless of which cartridge and specific load you decide to hunt with, it’s clear that recoil is a major consideration you should keep in mind. Do you need a cartridge ideally suited for hunting dangerous game like grizzly bear, cape buffalo, water buffalo, or elephant? The 405 Winchester uses a larger diameter bullet than the 400/408 barrel that Shiloh puts on their 40 caliber rifles. Jeffery & Company produced the majority of rifles used by British hunters in Africa and India. The 480 grain .458 Win Mag offers another modest step down in recoil energy, but that load is no pussycat either. And both the .30-06 and .308 rounds were introduced commercially to U.S. citizens at around the same time they were adopted by the military..30-06 Springfield Overview. For instance, that .458 Lott Hornady load has nearly as much energy remaining at 100 yards as the .458 Win Mag Woodleigh load has at the muzzle. While the cartridge is capable of using 325-550 grain bullets, the majority of .458 Lott factory loads shoot either 500 grain or 550 grain bullets. More. This all created a unique confluence of events whereby large numbers of American hunters were itching to hunt Africa, but there were limited supplies of firearms and ammunition suitable for use on game like buffalo and elephant. All of those loads meet or exceed the performance of several very popular and effective .450 Nitro loads from decades prior. Ample supplies of rifles and ammunition for those cartridges were available to Americans and both cartridges were adequate for use on dangerous game. This removed the need to glue bullets in place and, in combination with the fact that Winchester began using a different type of powder, eliminated the problems with squib loads virtually overnight. In particular, the CZ 550 is a very popular option. I’ve never shot one myself and I’m somewhat skeptical of the utility of that rifle for a hunter, but it was a novel idea to be sure. Better yet are the “standard” .30 calibers; guns like the .308 and .30-06. However, the .458 Lott has a longer case length (2.8″ vs 2.5″) and a longer overall length (3.6″ vs 3.34″). It was designed to compete against the .450 Nitro Express and the .470 Nitro Express cartridges used in big bore British double rifles. Put simply, a bullet with more momentum will be harder to stop than a bullet with less momentum (all other things being equal). At the same time, the Kimber Caprivi is also an option for a current production .458 Lott rifle. On the other hand, the .458 Lott uses a larger case that provides more flexibility and a higher ceiling on its maximum performance than the case used by the .458 Winchester Magnum. Are you a handloader? .30-06 Springfield vs .405 Winchester. In 1908, the Model 1895 Winchester lever action rifle was the first commercially produced .30-06 rifle. Heck, these cartridges are big and heavy enough that the weight added by fully loading the rifle magazine will also work to reduce recoil energy by a measurable amount. With modern ammunition, both cartridges are excellent choices with proven reputations afield. Your email address will not be published. There are also a fair number of rifles out there that started out as a .458 Winchester Magnum, but were been converted to .458 Lott at some point as well. That load is roughly comparable to .458 Win Mag ammo and is still extremely effective on dangerous game, but doesn’t have quite as much recoil as the full power .458 Lott ammo. When Browning acquired Winchester several years ago, this led to a variety of '86 iterations. This means that the momentum of a rifle's reaction will exactly equal the momentum of the … For that reason, many outfitters discourage clients from using a muzzle brake. The chart also contains data for a .458 Win Mag hand load of a 480 grain DGX Bonded (.285 BC) at 2,200 feet per second. Case capacities were obtained from Kwk. That’s not a tremendous difference, but it’s also not nothing either. For instance, a .458 Win Mag load firing a 450 grain bullet at 2,240fps has a momentum value of 144 ft-lbs/sec, a 480 grain bullet at 2,200fps has a momentum value of 150 ft-lbs/sec, a 500 grain bullet at 2,050fps has a momentum value of 146 ft-lbs/sec, and a 500 grain bullet at 2,150fps has a momentum value of 153 ft-lbs/sec. The .405 Winchester (also known as the .405 WCF) is a centerfire rifle cartridge introduced in 1904 for the Winchester 1895 lever-action rifle. Climbing Lazy Mountain Near Palmer…It’s Not For the Lazy. It’s a bit heavy as a result of all that walnut, but the recoil is, by any standard, surprisingly tame and pleasant when shooting thanks to that weight. Unfortunately, there are a few genuine misunderstandings regarding the capabilities of the .458 Winchester Magnum. Thus, using that lighter weight bullet virtually eliminates any case capacity issues with the cartridge. Get a good hunting rifle chambered in the cartridge that you think fits your needs the best, learn to shoot it well, use quality bullets, and you’ll be all set for most hunting situations. I have used Woodliegh for years in all guns but now I may need to try out some others. Indeed, both cartridges offer a fair bit of options for handloaders. I have not got my Winchester to shoot black worth a crap. The good news is that even that 450 grain bullet still meets Kevin Robertson’s recommended SD of .300 for hunting cape buffalo (outlined on p98 of his book Africa’s Most Dangerous). Since they’re both descended from the .375 H&H Magnum the two cartridges have a similar straight tapered case. will all increase the weight of the rifle and dampen recoil to a certain extent. There was also a strong desire among these hunters to use an American designed rifle and cartridge. When shooting the same weight bullets as the .458 Lott, the .458 Win Mag shoots them at a slower velocity. Especially when hunting dangerous game, bullet momentum is also a very important characteristic. Outdoor Life footed the bill for O’Connor’s first safari in 1953 and the stories of his exploits on that hunt and his subsequent trips to Africa filled the pages magazine, as well as the dreams of many American hunters, over the next two decades. This means I will earn a small commission (at no extra cost to you) if you make a purchase. Even so, the .458 Winchester Magnum is still a very powerful cartridge and is more than powerful enough to quickly and ethically kill any species of big game on this planet. To make matters worse, some of these horror stories about sub-par performance on part of the .458 Winchester Magnum involved hunters getting injured or killed by wounded game. Additionally, though it does have a very stout recoil, the .458 Win Mag has a noticeable advantage over the .458 Lott in this area as well. While they’re both usually much more expensive than smaller bore centerfire rifle hunting ammo, .458 Win Mag ammo is generally moderately cheaper than .458 Lott ammo. Cheers Mark also from Australia. My question would be that it a 400 gr 405 is running 2,000 + how is that generating more energy than 400-405 gr or 425-430 LBT's running out of a 45-70 at 2000-2200. Bumping that velocity up to the 2,300 feet per second advertised with many .458 Lott factory loads will increase that recoil disparity even more. IMR recommends always consulting www.IMRReloading.com for … A 550 grain .458″ bullet has a sectional density of .375, a 500 grain .458″ bullet has a sectional density of .341, a 480 grain .458″ bullet has a sectional density of .327, and a 450 grain .458″ bullet has a sectional density of .306. This helps support the blog and allows me to continue to create free content that’s useful to hunters like yourself. Since it can fire heavier bullets and achieve higher velocities than the .458 Winchester Magnum, the .458 Lott has an advantage in this area as well.  I bought a custom .458 Magnum bolt action back in the ’70’s, made by Herter’s to my dimensions, with a Pachmayr ventilated recoil pad, a high rollover comb pitched steeply towards the receiver, stocked to the muzzle (Mannlicher-style) and Magnaported. I suspect the recoil velocity is the reason. Yes, the .458 Lott is more powerful than the .458 Win Mag, but it’s not clear that all that extra energy actually translates into improved killing power in the real world AND it also comes with extra recoil. mag is the ran ge at which larger game can be taken, and in the case of .308 vs .30-06 that difference is maybe an extra 20 or 30 yards for the -06. Winchester built the .458 Winchester Magnum using a modified .375 H&H case that was necked up to use .458″ bullets and shortened from 2.85″ down to 2.5″ long.

That’s why the Barnes factory load for the .458 Win Mag uses a 450 grain bullet and the Barnes .458 Lott factory load uses a 500 grain bullet. The rifle situation is very similar to the ammunition situation with these cartridges: there are a handful of options for each cartridge and there is also quite a bit of overlap in the rifles available in each chambering. The company needed a repeater that could compete with the new, inexpensive, bolt-action rifles being made by Mauser, Steyr, and others. Both cartridges use the same .458″ bullets, so there is no difference in frontal surface area (also known as cross sectional area) with the 458 Win Mag vs 458 Lott. I have couple of 30-03's in my collection. As a side note, Winchester initially offered the .458 Win Mag in their Model 70 rifle when they first rolled the cartridge out in 1956. This brings us full circle to the reason why the .458 Lott exists in the first place: the desire for a cartridge that can reliably shoot a 500 grain .458″ bullet at 2,150 feet per second under realistic conditions. That said, both are pretty common choices among hunters pursuing dangerous game who need a heavy hitting rifle.

This is especially true with monolithic bullets, like the Barnes TSX, that have a longer overall length than lead core bullets of the same weight.

These ‘bolt gu… cartridge came about in 1904, chambered in the Winchester Model 1895 rifle. It was introduced in 1904 in the John Browning designed Winchester Model 1895 rifle, and discontinued in 1932 when the company determined that the 1895 rifle was obsolete. In those cases, the .458 Lott is certainly a better choice as that extra case capacity is even more important with lower quality powder. The .405 Win.
