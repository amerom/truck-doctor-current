LiptonNon-native language use and risk of incident dementia in the elderly. Bilingualism has many benefits, including the opportunity to communicate across cultures. The present study aimed at exploring the influence of such bilingualism on the language profiles of children from this population at risk for language impairment (LI). When a Specific Language Impairment occurs, symptoms typically occur. Some studies have shown that if you know two or more languages — and you have risk factors for Alzheimer's — you may experience a delay in the onset of Alzheimer's symptoms. In fact, active bilingualism is an important predictor of delay in the onset of symptoms of mild cognitive impairment — a preclinical phase of Alzheimer’s disease — because it contributes to cognitive reserve” — the brain’s resistance to cognitive damage or degeneration. However, some research has found that speaking more than one language has advantages that go far beyond communication.

In this study 160 children, aged 11 years with a definite history of specific language impairment (SLI), completed four tasks that could be potential positive psycholinguistic markers for this impairment: a third person singular task, a past tense task, a nonword repetition task, and a sentence repetition task. 16/11/2017.

Lastly, language is such an integral part of one’s culture and identity so please do not seclude your child from a cultural community by limiting their linguistic surrounding. Results While bilingual children’s scores on each subtest were significantly lower compared to their functional monolingual peers, they were no more likely to fall in the at-risk range based on a combination of all 4 subtests. Most of the evidence about bilingualism and language impairment shows support for the perspective that bilingualism does not increase risk for impairment and that overall, distributions of impairment by level of severity are similar for monolinguals (children learning one language) and bilinguals (children learning two languages). The present study aimed at exploring the influence of such bilingualism on the language profiles of children from this population at risk for language impairment (LI). In contrast, working memory was found to be a relative strength of bilingual children with LI, who performed better in this area than monolingual peers with LI when controlling for language ability. Conclusion: Bilingual children displayed a higher risk of a diagnosis of severe language impairment and of being discharged for non-attendance. • Preterm-born children are at risk for EF impairments.
