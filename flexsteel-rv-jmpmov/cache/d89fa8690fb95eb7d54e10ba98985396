In July 2020 the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty was extended by 38 square kilometres – the first change to an AONB since 1991. Contains or is based on public sector information licensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0, provided by Natural England or JNCC. The indicator (Figure C1ii) identifies the proportion of these features – by feature or by area – that are in a desired state (favourable) or have appropriate management but are yet to have regained their favourable status (unfavourable-recovering). Protected areas are typically designated by national governments. Map of UK terrestrial and marine protected areas, as at 25 September 2020. The condition graph is cumulative and includes assessments from a number of years. In 2017, this weighting was adjusted to the end of the financial year (except for 2006 and 2008) to match the end of financial year date stamp of the condition data. Target 8: By 2020, pollution, including from excess nutrients, has been brought to levels that are not detrimental to ecosystem function and biodiversity. terrestrial sites as at 31 March 2020, with the exception of an extension to the Suffolk Coast and Heaths AONB calculated on 24 July 2020. marine sites – calculated as at 25 September 2020 due to the designation of a large MPA in Scottish waters. For comparison, the same figures for the terrestrial A/SSSI, MCZ, NCMPA, NNR, Ramsar, Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) and Special Protection Areas (SPA) site designations are given in Table C1ii. Don’t worry we won’t send you spam or share your email address with anyone. Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), protected under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The proportion in unfavourable-recovering condition has increased from 17% in 2005 to 31% in 2020 for SACs, and from 9% to 27% for SPAs. Source: Natural England, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, NatureScot. This identifies which sites protect features (or ‘components’) in the marine environment (below high water), and therefore qualify the site as an MPA. Use Magic Map to check if the planning proposal relates to land on or near a protected site. England figures based on area; Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland figures based on number of features. The EU’s Natura 2000 network and the Bern Convention’s Emerald Network are ecological networks of protected areas, set up to ensure the survival of Europe's most valuable species and habitats. This change reflects improved management of sites, but is also affected by a greater number of sites/features having been assessed over time. Figure C1v. In the UK, there are a few types of Marine Protected Areas. Target 5: By 2020, the rate of loss of all natural habitats, including forests, is at least halved and where feasible brought close to zero, and degradation and fragmentation is significantly reduced. Scotland and Northern Ireland figures based on number of features. Methods and aims of protection vary depending on the nature and importance of the resource. The Directive requires the establishment of protected areas (Special Areas of Conservation – SACs) for a number of listed habitats and species, in areas of sea under the jurisdiction of Member States (i.e. The underpinning legislation for A/SSSIs extends to low water, so the condition part of the indicator is mainly based on terrestrial features. wider landscape designations: Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) (England, Wales and Northern Ireland), National Scenic Areas (NSA) (Scotland), and National Parks (England, Scotland and Wales). The UK Government designated the MCZ network through a phased approach and designated the first 27 sites at the end of 2013. Target 6: By 2020 all fish and invertebrate stocks and aquatic plants are managed and harvested sustainably, legally and applying ecosystem based approaches, so that overfishing is avoided, recovery plans and measures are in place for all depleted species, fisheries have no significant adverse impacts on threatened species and vulnerable ecosystems and the impacts of fisheries on stocks, species and ecosystems are within safe ecological limits. This has a negligible effect on the areas calculated. Of the protected areas created before the CBD was ratified 1992, 55% have since experienced human pressure increases. Click a marker to view the record to which it relates: Directorate: Environment and Forestry Directorate. 8. part 3 essex. The unparishe… Imputation has been used to calculate the breakdown between favourable and unfavourable-recovering for Northern Ireland for the years 2009 to 2011. Ingatestone and Fryerning, 5. You can search for protected areas within Northern Ireland by following the links below where you will find associated guidance and literature. Terrestrial changes since 1995 mainly reflect the establishment of SACs and SPAs, plus the designation of 2 National Parks in Scotland in 2002/03. The extent of protected areas on land has increased by 14,462 hectares since 2015. 4. As at 24 July 2020, over 6.7 MHa of land and freshwater have been designated under national and international legislation – representing 28% of the land area of the UK (Table C1i). Target 11: By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well-connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscape and seascapes. Previously the split between marine and terrestrial was taken to be at the high-water mark (see the technical document for details). Extent is based on the following site designations: Areas of Special Scientific Interest (Northern Ireland), Sites of Special Scientific Interest (England, Scotland and Wales), National Nature Reserves, Marine Conservation Zones, Nature Conservation Marine Protected Areas, Ramsar Sites, Special Areas of Conservation (including candidate Special Areas of Conservation and Sites of Community Importance), Special Protection Areas, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, National Scenic Areas, National Parks. Only use the name search if you know the exact name of the protected area. The authors looked at global “Human Footprint” maps to make their assessment which shows that 32.8% of protected land is highly degraded. The map currently contains information on Special Areas of Conservation (SAC), Special Protection Areas (SPA), Voluntary MPAs and Marine Nature Reserves (MNR).However, at present, historical and cultural features are not included. Shellfish water protected areas: maps. The main change to the indicator is to the rise in the extent measures in 1980, which was due to the designation of 40 NSAs in Scotland. (n1) terrestrial sites as at 31 March 2020, with the exception of an extension to the Suffolk Coast and Heaths AONB calculated on 24 July 2020.marine sites – calculated as at 25 September 2020 due to the addition of a large MPA in Scottish waters designated on 25 September before publication of the 2020 UK Biodiversity Indicators. These assessments are converted to percentages in this indicator, to allow them to be combined, but the percentage does not equate exactly to the area that is favourable or unfavourable-recovering. You can also move to a different area of the map by clicking and dragging the blue hashed box ar… Assessment of change in extent and condition of UK protected areas, Table C1i. Conservation Areas in England as designated by Local Planning Authorities and compiled by English Heritage, with the limit of each CA recorded as a polygon. The entire series has been recalculated, so this is consistent between years in the presentation in the 2019 publication. The 2 extent measures are a calculation of the net (non-overlapping) extent of protected areas using mean high water as the boundary between the on-land and at-sea measures. Maps showing all the shellfish water protected areas in Scotland. Closer detail reveals many smaller places, often unprotected, that are rich in carbon and nature. 1) Restrict the leaseholder’s equity share to 80%, or; 2) Ensures that if 100% stair-casing is allowed, then the property is bought back by the landlord if it comes up for sale.
