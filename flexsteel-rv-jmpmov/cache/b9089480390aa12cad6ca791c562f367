Mechanical vs Electrical Engineering. I think I probably have a misconception that cars are becoming more electric and electronic than mechanical especially as I accidentally found Mr.Dan's video who is a mechanical engineer at Tesla giving invaluable career advice. You’ll study statics and dynamics, thermodynamics, fluid … A great example is in aviation; aircrafts had no electronics when they first came up, it was almost completely mechanical from top to the bottom but then fly-by-wire got involved and now we have got a whole new term as "avionics". Both present and future demand of electrical engineers would remain steady. The only problem, however, is that he or she just doesn’t know which field fits well for his or her interests. The electro-mechanical engineering degree entails the study of mathematics, physics, chemistry, materials, mechanical engineering, basic electrical engineering, basic analogue and digital electronics, the integration of these subjects in carefully structured design courses, control systems and management studies. A vast discipline, mechanical engineering is the design and maintenance of any object with moving parts. Mechatronics - Engineering the future Follow article. Now, 2020 is ... there will be an increase in the number of employment opportunities in both mechanical engineering and electrical engineering during the next three years. There are many jobs and opportunities in both areas - in engineering, information technology finance, commerce, … GreigRS 24 Jan 2017. Master’s degree programs are also available for engineers. My father is a Mechanical engineer, he got alot of money and also got job opportunities but he said is that Mechanical engineering is one of best stream among Engg but My son, i suggest you to choose ECE because you wont have any hesitation for getting job. If we recognise the first reference to it, when Japanese engineer Ko Kikuchi combined the words mechanical and electronics in 1969 then it’s been around 47 odd years. Back then, mechanical engineering meant everything but by the time new technologies came up and took over mechanical systems. MEP design is important for planning, decision making, accurate documentation, performance- and cost-estimation, construction, and operating/maintaining the resulting facilities. Together, these two occupations accounted for about 36 percent of new jobs for engineers. Job for ECE is at your doorstep. Mechatronics, IoT, and Industry 4.0 Mechatronics is a term which is popping up frequently these days, by the way, it’s not new. The Circuit Cellar staff thought it would be interesting to kick off 2015 by asking several long-time contributors about the future of electrical engineering and embedded systems. which are set to revolutionize the future, are the future of mechanical engineering, as they all depend on the principles laid down by mechanical engineering.  A minimum of a bachelor’s degree is required to work as an electrical, mechanical or civil engineer. Here we present the responses we received to the following questions: What are your thoughts on the future of electrical engineering? 5. 1 1 0. There was a time when talking about the year 2020 seemed like a discussion about the far-flung future. Mechanical engineering One of the oldest and broadest types of engineering, mechanical engineering is concerned with the design, manufacturing and maintenance of mechanical systems. I am currently studying Electrical Engineering at McGill University, however, I needed to take a computer class and because of that I now realize that I am really starting to enjoy programming. Mechanical engineers design and oversee the manufacture of many products ranging from medical devices to new batteries. Video: Mechanical vs. Electrical Engineering by Major Prep Video: Meet Dr. Aura Ganz by UMass Amherst Industrial Engineering. I am really liking my programming class (JAVA). Mechanical and industrial engineers are second and third in projected job growth among engineers. Engineer wages. It involves scientific, mathematical, economical, social, and practical applications in its goal to find ways and create things that can help improve man’s life and make his chores easier. Mechanical engineers design, build and test mechanical devices. originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain … You'd need a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, with … Agricultural engineers are tasked with combining elements of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, chemical engineering, and civil engineering in an effort to achieve agricultural–that is, farming and food production–goals. Aerospace engineers and mechanical engineers both work on the development and construction of equipment and devices. In high school, I enjoyed both Mechanics and E&M very much so its really tough for me to decide which … The Future of Mechatronics Engineering Technology. If both, then which one is more? Here I would like to present a more logical difference between these two disciplines of engineering and I hope it will help all young students and prospective students to get to know about these two branches of engineering. Mechanical engineering, in my opinion, is one of the most diverse engineering majors. I found it comforting. However, electrical engineers with additional expertise in electronics and computer hardware engineering are in greater demand than mechanical engineers. Electrical Engineering Programs Teach Electrical Theory and Systems Design … Electrical engineering degree programs are heavy on math and science courses. As a mechanical/electro- mechanical engineering student, you … Students must be prepared to understand and make calculations based on the underlying physics that govern electrical interactions. My debate is now whether to switch to software engineering or to stick to electrical. Regardless of the marketplace, the BLS notes that candidates who earn a bachelor's degree from a program accredited by ABET, formerly the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, and who are trained in the latest engineering … Mechatronics engineering is a combination of mechanical, electrical and computer systems engineering. So, Mechanical is just worker while ECE is manager. Note: I don't mind electrical engineering. Electrical engineers design new and better electronics. The expansion of the IoT may be a windfall to electrical engineers, who will be instrumental in designing the circuitry of IoT devices. Apart from this you must have passion for nuclear physics. 361 9. Mechatronics, which is also called mechatronics engineering is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering that focuses on the engineering of electronic, electrical and mechanical engineering systems, and also includes a combination of robotics, electronics, computer, telecommunications, systems, control, and product engineering. A lot of emerging technologies like nanotechnology, quantum mechanics, biomechanics, etc. Mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) refers to these aspects of building design and construction.In commercial buildings, these elements are often designed by a specialized engineering firm. If you like tinkering with electronics and sensing instrumentation, start out with electrical engineering; If you like building things that move and designing their interacting systems, start out with mechanical engineering.
