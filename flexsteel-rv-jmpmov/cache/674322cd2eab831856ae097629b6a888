(Ohio Dept of Transportation) A powerful storm system that included at least one tornado considered “large and dangerous” passed through Ohio late Monday that resulted in widespread damage, including … Unable to deal with the author's favourite, the Chapter Master called in an orbital strike on his own monastery and despite being in a breached battlesuit, Kais somehow survived and popped out of the wreckage like Wile E. Coyote. Their power over the Tau i… With a secondary duty of keeping the Ethereal Aun'el Shi'Ores safe, Kais' forces occupied the planetary capital of Or'es Tash'n and made ready to slowly take the planet back for the Tau Empire. I just got the Start Collecting: Tau set because I loved Tau from using them when I was younger in Dawn of War: Dark Crusade. So Farsight set out with another huge fleet and a trio of Ethereals to repair the damage and take back planets. Join Facebook to connect with Shas'o Tau Kais and others you may know. Join Facebook to connect with Shas O Kais and others you may know. Sed nec velit ut nisl tristique posuere quis eu neque. Hopefully like other bad ideas this will be forgotten. He is the only faction leader (with the exception of the Ork Warboss Gorgutz), who clearly survives if the T'au are defeated. Nulla auctor quam in ligula tempor tristique. Shas'la T'au Kais' first mission was an attempt to rescue the Tau Ethereal Aun'el Ko'vash from the corrupt Imperial Planetary Governor Meyloch Severus on the Imperial Desert W… Knowing Kais he probably held the fucking line himself before curb stomping three or four Great Unclean Ones to death. u/Tikinola. Farsight - Crisis of Faith revealed that while he, Farsight, and Shadownsun are bonded, Kais committed a deed that forever drove a wedge between the three. His feats quickly become fucking ridiculous, like being able to solo eight Terminators and make Devastator Squads and Librarians shoot each other somehow, as well as no-scope-no-look headshot a Marine with his pistol through a hole in his suit made by that Marine's plasma gun, all while he was flying in the air, and even the Chapter Master and his guard were helpless to stop him. Unfortunately, making this guy is kinda hard, seeing as the XV22 is only available for Shadowsun. Along with Commanders Farsight and Shadowsun, he was one of the three top students of Commander Puretide, who led the T'au forces that took Kronus from the Imperium in the first place. If Shas'O Kais is your Warlord you may purchase Aun'El Shi'Ores without taking up a HQ slot. This page was last edited on 16 August 2020, at 17:10. Or'es'Ka is a tough son of a bitch. Kais is akin to a Magikarp: when he starts out, he'll only have his piddling little burst cannon to fight with and can't even jump because you need a wargear for that, but give him a few upgrades and he'll be kicking ass and taking names in no time. It's mentioned in the Damocles Anthology that Shadowsun had a career as a Shas'la prior to becoming Puretide's protege so it's entirely possible that Shas'O Kais is both a kick-ass fighter and a man burdened by daddy issues, if he indeed had a career prior to Puretide noticing him. He set up a series of worlds that would become known as the Farsight Enclaves. One of the only commanders in the entire campaign willing to negotiate and talk common sense, Kais is nonetheless an exceptional badass for a Tau, and proves he can get shit done. Or'es'Ka led his forces from the moon of Nan'Yanoi, where he had built his system-wide Death Star analogue, and began using it to orbital strike the ever-living fuck out of the (likely fake) Gorgutz' Orks and the Space Marines under Indrick Boreale. Whereas his predecessor, Shas'o Kais, tends to give a surrender ultimatum before attacking, Or'es'Ka prefers to lead off by orbital striking a population center, then threatening that his forces will cheerfully pound their area until it resembles the results of a protracted cyclonic torpedo bombing if they fail to see the wisdom of the Greater Good. There's also this pdf. To further this objective, his forces created a massive orbital ion cannon on one of Kaurava's moons and use it to airstrike their enemies before every attack. A Shas'el will usually command smaller engagements of small Cadres leaving full Cadre and multi-Cadre actions to a full Shas'o. Still, if he does return, lulz and Exterminatus are sure to follow. However at the head of a properly prepared army he can straight up annihilate any opponent with his warlord trait to deliver the alpha strike of alpha strikes, by buffing certain weapons to the stratosphere. One can rectify this by simply putting the helmet on her, and with a little kitbashing magic, swap one of the Fusion guns for a plasma rifle. To complete the symmetry with Shas'O Kais, here's a tabletop version of Commander Or'es'Ka. And just because you haven't done it because you don't care doesn't mean there aren't a large percentage of woman who absolutely do care and do ask. Cras magna dolor, commodo non aliquam vitae, fermentum eget urna. However, unlike Kais, who gets battle drones, Or'es'ka gets marker drones that further boost his accuracy, functionally giving all of his weapons 100% hit rates, and ensuring he cannot miss with his cyclic ion blaster or missile pods, making him death incarnate for unprepared foes. Kais did some major damage during the Dark Crusade, and was rather infamous for the damage his forces did to the Orks and Eldar during the war, and they engaged in some truly bitter fighting with Governor-Militant Lukas Alexander's men. The second is the deliberate refusal to follow the path of the Greater Good when it is clear it must be." In 740.M41, Shas'O Kais was dispatched to quell the troubles on Kronus, and brought along the Fire Caste and the Tau allies, the Vespid and Kroot. The Ethereals brought the two sides together to negotiate and convinced them to follow the Greater Good. Pts WS BS S T W I Ld Sv 90pts 3 4 3 4 3 3 10 4+ O' Kais can be used in a Tau Epire army of 500pts or more, he leads a personal command of Firewarriors (Honour Guard), he is not counted as the compusory HQ choice Equipment= Custom Pulse … The fact that he's the most merciful commander in the setting does not stop him from getting a body count in the thousands. Shi'ur was ultimately killed by Tyranidswhile defending a Tau world.

Allgemein. When he finally goes into action, he storms an Astartes fortress-monastery in a Ghostkeel, and somehow manages to dodge shit with it (and no, we're not talking about guns whose targeting systems were fucked by it). After the Damocles Crusade, Farsight was tasked with rebuilding a series of lost colonies that had been overrun by Chaos forces. He, under the leadership of the T'au Ethereal Aun'El Shi'Or'es, sought to reclaim the planet for the T'au Empire. A massive asshole, but a man willing to do anything to get shit done, Shas'O Or'es'Ka is the Tau equivalent of that asshole who brings 30 Deathstrikes to an Apocalypse game. He also went after the Kauravan Imperial Guard forces, dealing massive damage to all involved. An icon used to represent a menu that can be toggled by interacting with this icon. According to the Tau 8th Edition Codex, he had a role in the Plague Wars, defending the planet Kellik from the forces of the Death Guard. His anti-infantry burst cannon can be replaced with an anti-vehicle fusion blaster and later an anti-everything plasma rifle. Further Developments from "War of Secrets" have Turned Shas'O Kais into a T'au Mary Sue, seriously. He's a hell of a lot less of a dick than Commander Or'es'Ka, though. Shi'ur was quite distant, eventually leading Kais to resent that he would never be worthy in his father's eyes. Along the way he was attacked by Space Marines, who he managed to defeat by climbing in an original Coldstar suit (yes, it has a female AI and yes she's a tsundere), and at the direction of a Daemo… It's on the painting board cos he's to be painted! In the ensuing Farsight Expedition, Farsight led an enormous Tau fleet across the Damocles … With the T'au spiritual leader dead, their war machine broke ranks when morale plummeted; Kais gathered together the survivors and got them out of the system, making him one of the four three commanders to survive the Dark Crusade (Eliphas still died, he just came back thanks to Chaos shenanigans). Archived. Among his other upgrades are a helm that lets him detect infiltrated units, iridium armour that increases his health and reduces the damage he takes and a cloaking field that infiltrates him, making him one of only two commanders able to become invisible. An indirect sequel to Deffwotch, and direct sequel to Squat Crusade: The Musical, Exelion: Anarchy Reigns is an alternative morality Rogue Trader campaign GM'd by Shas'o R'myr. Kais is akin to a Magikarp: when he starts out, he'll only have his piddling little burst cannon to fight with and can't even jump because you need a wargear for that, but give him a few upgrades and he'll be kicking ass and taking names in no time. Overall worse saves with lower Toughness and Wounds, he's not going to hang around as much. He's not quite as durable as Shas'o Kais, as his shield generator provides the same HP boost as Kais' iridium armor, but provides a unilateral 33% defense bonus to ranged fire, unlike Kais' general 33% defense bonus. Shas'O Tau Montau Kais. Shas'o Kais. Shas'o Tau Kais is on Facebook. Or'es'Ka lacks the HP boost of Kais' helmet, as well. Geschichte.
