Summary: Self-perception theory describes the process in which people, lacking initial attitudes or emotional responses, develop them by observing their own behavior and coming to conclusions as to what attitudes must have driven that behavior. For example, we can gain self-esteem by perceiving ourselves as members of important and valued groups that make us feel good about ourselves. BIBLIOGRAPHY.

Assumptions of the Self-Care Deficit Theory. Self-Affirmation Theory.

Social identity theory asserts that we draw part of our sense of identity and self-esteem from the social groups that we belong to (Hogg, 2003; Oakes, Haslam, & Turner, 1994; Tajfel, 1981).
