Whatâs worth noting is that this kind of product vision talks about the outcomes only, not how they are achieved â you could build a product thatâs not an enterprise social network and still have the same vision; you could even make a non-digital product with the same vision (organize employee discussion groups, perhaps). I think that the Moore template discussed in the âvisionâ section above might actually be a good discussion starter to set a product strategy â it does need additional context and nuance though (for instance, most products arenât sold to just one narrow customer group or solve only one narrow customer problem).

These product goals could be things that must be accomplished over the next year â for example, growing revenue, reducing churn, and improving customer satisfaction â or they might be more strategic product goals. This process starts with a crystal clear understanding of the product vision. An extra benefit of utilizing a top-down strategy (aside from providing clarity and direction to the product team devising the roadmap) is helping get stakeholders onboard with the plan. In general, a product roadmap is a visual representation of a plan for the creation of a particular product or a group of products. In the age of agile development, however, a roadmap has become much more of a living document. With a roadmap for engineers, however, there’s a stronger focus on specific features. Think of your product roadmap as a timeline of all of the most important events across product development, marketing, and top management teams â itâs not just an engineering specification, rather it should be an opportunity to align all departments against a single, complete product visionâ¦ Through grouping, color-coding, and persistent visual elements, a visual roadmap is far easier to consume. The product roadmap has several ultimate goals: Ideally, your product roadmap should convey the strategic direction for your product. from more traditional single or multi-product ones. The two interesting points about this template are that it focuses on a customer need to be solved, and that it forces one to think about differentiation / competitive position. The Product Coalition. This template is originally from âCrossing the Chasmâ by Geoffrey Moore. gives roadmaps structure, both visually and for the narrative. Roadmaps come in different forms. Ignoring key topics such as scalability, cybersecurity, and technical debt is pennywise and pounds foolish. But you do need a way to clearly outline and prioritize short-term features, medium-term features, and features youâre planning for in the long term. For all layers of the product strategy pyramid, there are different definitions, and none of them are inherently right or wrong. In the age of agile development, however, a roadmap has become much more of a living document. It should illustrate how enhancements move vital metrics that matter most to that cohort. Clearly articulating the product vision and strategy can make it easier to secure executive buy-in. And don’t forget about version control issues! The vision is owned by the product owner. The layers keep the discussion from being a feature vs. feature battle royale. hbspt.cta.load(3434168, 'b7a15022-11a3-4849-afdf-70db7165595f', {}); Create beautiful roadmaps in minutes. When designing a product roadmap for customers and prospects, the focus should be entirely on the product’s benefits to them. It helps the team to understand the big picture and is the basis of a roadmap. Letâs break them down one by one. Product management coach Roman Pichler argues that a vision should not be too constraining in terms of the how, but rather just answer the following questions: What is your purpose for creating the product?What positive change should it bring about? And it should also tie back to the strategy for the company. The emphasis must be on how the planned work will increase the value of the product (and company). Creating and maintaining roadmaps takes a lot of effort and attention to detail. A product roadmap communicates the why and what behind what you’re building. While âroadmapâ is the concept that at its surface seems clearest, it is actually also ambiguous. Keep the roadmap clear of any undeserving inclusions by applying a few filters: hbspt.cta.load(3434168, '4a6bc7bb-4a31-4597-a392-485a84e4207f', {}); Every roadmap should include things that get the audience excited, such as new functionality and integrations. If the presenter doesn’t proactively address them (either in the roadmap itself or in the commentary offered during the presentation), they’re likely to be brought up and put the presenter on the defensive. In the same vein, she continues her argument that this kind of roadmap shouldnât contain concrete dates, but rather just time horizons: now, near term, future. It also sets the direction for where a product is headed, or the end state for what a product will deliver in the future. If time isn’t allocated in the roadmap upfront for these things, it will feel more like an unexpected delay, slip, or poor planning than simply acknowledging upfront that you’ve got to eat your vegetables. Not to mention that the products themselves might be in entirely different stages. If it was, please drop me a ð below, or leave a comment. After adopting top-down planning and themes to add strategy and structure to the roadmapping process, present the hierarchical thought process behind the roadmap in the artifact itself. Whenever possible, group similar features/items into themes that sales reps can discuss with prospects. Does it have actual value to users? But roadmaps are the culmination of prioritization and scheduling realities. If both revenue generation and infrastructure are their own themes (and have similar goals), they each deserve a share of development resources. Some, like Richard Banfield, Martin Eriksson and Nate Walkingshaw in their book âProduct Leadershipâ describe that a product vision should be equal to the company vision (/mission), or at least at the same level: The company vision is unlikely to change much. Ideally it also describes how you will build up a sustainable competitive advantage, and what growth loops you will employ. The Connection Between Resilient Entrepreneurs and Business Success, Why Sometimes itâs Better to Sell Picks and Shovels than Mine for Gold, One Fear That 30% of Small Business Owners Share, and 5 Ideas to Tame It, Transforming an Amsterdam brothel into a home, .. a freelance writer.. a digital nomad.. a DJ, The roles and responsibilities of a startup CEO and its founding team. Arguably, that discussion itself is as important as the goal that results from it, and therefore should be part of the strategy. They’re expected to do more, to serve additional cohorts, to integrate with other products and services. However, the example given is actually quite different: âFor Fredwin Cycling, the vision is to be the #1 social fitness cycling application on the market.â Two notable differences to the high-level kind of vision: firstly, this vision is specific about what the company is building (a âsocial fitness cycling applicationâ). In contrast to the term âproduct visionâ, these are somewhat more well defined. The âThis is Product Managementâ definition of the product roadmap is maybe the one that most people would give intuitively: The product roadmap describes what products and features will be built to realize the strategy and vision, who is responsible for building those product features, and, sometimes, an estimate of when those products and features will be released. Well-documented facts should support this claim, and metrics should be driving feature decisions. If time isn’t allocated in the roadmap upfront for these things, it will feel more like an unexpected delay, slip, or poor planning than simply acknowledging upfront that you’ve got to eat your vegetables. And Agile roadmaps may look a little different from more traditional single or multi-product ones. A product roadmap is a tool used by PMâs to communicate the what and the why of a product. Although similar to executives, investors and board members also require their flavor of roadmap. A product roadmap, just like any other map, helps individualsâor, in most cases, groups and teamsânavigate between two points. How Does Agile Development Affect Today’s Roadmaps? Accordingly, the definition given by Banfield/Eriksson/Walkingshaw in âProduct Leadershipâ is to focus not on features but rather problems: Because itâs a strategic document, what you want to convey in your roadmap is not a series of features or solutions but themes around the customer problems you intend to focus on and why. Itâs a plan of action that aligns the organization around short- and long-term goals for the product â¦ An outdated roadmap only leads to confusion and false expectations. So the question here is only if the roadmap includes dates or not, right? And don’t forget about version control issues! The roadmaps have far shorter timeframes and need more frequent adjustments to accommodate changing priorities and market opportunities. The strategy, goals, and themes are the key messages to convey. This confusion is why it’s essential to use a tool that makes it simple and easy to make frequent updates as soon as possible. Note that roadmaps aren’t limited to products. Roadmaps free for 30 â¦ This makes the vision future-proof so that it can truly serve as long-term guidance. Here are four examples of roadmap constituencies, and the primary function the roadmap serves for them. For a truly deep understanding of the product and its vision, you need to understand what your product is useful for, who itâs for, and howyou plan to make it better. The vision describes the high level of detail where we want to reach with the product in the long term. Just as a sales rep sharing an internal roadmap with prospects can commit the team prematurely to a release date, external roadmaps run the same risk of over-commitment. However, product goals and themes should still be a component of these roadmaps. High-level goals that stem directly from the strategy are set and revised in a quarterly OKR process. Elements of Mission and Vision Statements are often combined to provide a statement of the companyâs purposes, goals and values. Updating existing roadmaps has its own set of challenges, but creating one from scratch is a tall order for any product manager. But all that hard work might go for naught if the presentation of the final product doesn’t go well. A great roadmap helps PMâs achieve the following: A great roadmap helps PMâs achieve the following: 1, It ensures the product team understand what they are working towards, by aligning the product â¦ Engineering roadmaps should include as much granularity as possible. In contrast to the vision, which should have a lifetime of many years, a product strategy is typically seen to look at a horizon of months to a few years. Within that framework, of course, is the general order of what you’ll be building. As a rule of thumb, it depicts a strategy of product â¦ The product strategy, in my mind, needs to be explicit about âhow we will winâ. Within that framework, of course, is the general order of what you’ll be building. What a product roadmap captures is the vision and strategy of the product, and it serves as a guide for executing that strategy, while getting internal stakeholders aligned, facilitating â¦ A Vision Statement describes the desired future position of the company. And there’s plenty of. For those using agile development methods, these roadmaps are often at the epic or feature level.
