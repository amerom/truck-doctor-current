Migration towards coasts led to strong development on land, which often lead to destruction of important coastal ecosystems like mangroves and sea grass beds. [6][7] Coral reefs are fragile, partly because they are sensitive to water conditions. During compilation of this review, it has become evident that while coral restoration projects aim to solve the problem of habitat loss on coral reefs, some techniques may inadvertently contribute to the very problem they are trying to mitigate. One of the worst effects of coral reef destruction on the environment is the disappearance of this balance, which can lead to extremely negative effects ranging from barren landscapes and strong storm sweeping through landmasses, to acidic and poisonous ocean water that can also lead to the formation of dangerous giant waves, acid rain and the worsening of climate change conditions. Understand which fish are caught in a way that damages reefs, and spread the word. You can also make your home more energy-efficient and be more particular about buying local products that are ethically made. 1. Not using products obtained through damaging the environment is a way to help protect the reefs. From subsistence level fishing to the live fish trade, inadequate fisheries management is forcing the decline of fish stocks. These activities will no longer be possible if coral reefs disappear. The degradation of the world’s largest living structure has resulted in significant habitat loss for turtles, fish and sea birds. Also, specifically in the case of coral reef ecosystems, biodiversity has a strong impact on protecting and supporting coastal ecosystems. Coral reef managers are unable to directly mitigate or influence the main cause of mass bleaching: above average water temperatures. The Catlin scientists said the state of the regions' reefs would act as an early warning of problems besetting all of the world's coral. It ensures the resilience of life, making sure that some species will survive even under the most dire of circumstances. Jennifer Koss, director of NOAA's coral reef conservation program, told The Guardian Wednesday that while the degradation of reefs has in the past … A team working on the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean found that invasive rats on the islands are a "big problem" for coral reefs. The cover of live hard coral on these reefs ranges from 20% in Tanzania to 80% on the deeper reefs of Mo- zambique.
