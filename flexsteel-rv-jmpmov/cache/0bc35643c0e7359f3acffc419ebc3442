Though she sings in English, hearing her sing, one could almost imagine that sailors from the Greek Islands have been singing it for centuries. The band broke up in 2013 after having all their equipment stolen, which seemed both tragic and unnecessary: all the equipment this group ever needed was locked away in their breastbones and throats. – Jordan Becker, I’ve written about this song before, and in the years since I discovered it, my appreciation of it has only grown. Or, we presume, love. The Scottish group Camera Obscura upended the track with their 2007 cover. ABBA Benny Andersson Björn Ulvaeus B-side to Money, Money, Money: 1976 "Dance (While the Music Still Goes On)" ABBA Benny Andersson Björn Ulvaeus Waterloo: 1974 "Dancing Queen" ABBA Benny Andersson Björn Ulvaeus Stig Anderson Arrival: 1976 "Disillusion" ABBA Agnetha Fältskog Björn Ulvaeus Ring Ring: 1973 "Does Your Mother Know" ABBA However, start this jam from the the beginning and, despite the R&B quiet storm vibe that moves things forward, the DNA of the song is clearly present. His version of âMoney, Money, Money,” included in the 1000 Years of Popular Music collection (which you can read about in more detail here) is no exception. – Jordan Becker, “Angel Eyes,” featured on the 1979 ABBA album Voulez-Vouz, is an upbeat affair that warns against being hypnotized by looking into his angel eyes. The Swedish pop group is known for having some sad songs. movie’s success (commercial success, that is, as the reviews were not kind – a true ABBA divide, there). A later edition was fleshed out with rarities and live tracks, including this accordion-driven romp through the favorite song of Steve Coogan alter-ego, Alan Partridge. The best part is, the song overdelivers on the promising premise, which is how it ended up being our favorite cover of 2016. As a general rule, if Thompson covers one of your songs, he is likely to improve it. Whitley’s is the best. Certainly the singing Soderberg sisters in First Aid Kit do, and their live cover of “Chiquitita” is a marvelous example of that. CDs Vinyl. It’s a total tearjerker and fits perfectly with the Volebeats’ reverb-drenched slide guitars and straightforward, harmonized vocal delivery. Their “Waterloo,” for instance, borrows some extra rocket fuel from Alice Cooper’s “School’s Out,” then finishes by quoting Deep Purple’s “Child in Time.” And it works – even better because the song’s strong enough to hold it up. While anyone who has been on a dance floor at a wedding can probably belt out the chorus to half a dozen ABBA tunes, few could probably make it through the verse, let alone analyze the lyrics to find some deeper existential meaning. This coverâs rhythm is more pronounced with a driving drum. In 1974 Abba won the Eurovision Song Contest. But thirty other artists do. While many of the tracks are compelling reinterpretations of ABBAâs music, the opener âI Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Doâ is a real standout. Songwriters Benny Andersson and BjÃ¶rn Ulvaeus, sometimes aided by band manager Stig Anderson, penned songs that still rise above the cheese-tacular performances. It actually popped out as a single in 1998, but I don’t recall much impact at the time. – Curtis Zimmermann, Largely remembered for the one hit wonder of “Mary’s Prayer,” Scottish trio Danny Wilson’s followup LP Bebop Moptop found few buyers. No, none of Cher’s make the list. This song is sung by Abba. Wainwright’s performance plays it straight, just him and his guitar on stage. Creating a backing track where Benny’s predominant synthesizer work rested on an insistent drum beat, brightened up by sparkling acoustic guitars, ‘When All Is Said And Done’ was, even in this embryonic state, certainly the catchiest of the three new recordings. I mean, how sad can four millionaires be, especially four millionaires with as many hit records under their rhinestone-studded belts as the members of Abba have? He gives the song an almost Michael Stipe feel on top of the deftly picked backing, transforming faux-baroque into old Americana – a masterful alchemy which would segue well into the band’s more typical plaid-workshirt fare. – Walt Falconer, One rarely listens to ABBA for the subtleties of the lyrics. With a ska punk sound, the Mad Caddies bring more aggression and heaviness while not blowing up the original. The result is brooding, disorienting, and, ultimately, sad. – Patrick Robbins, I always considered this one of the archer – and therefore better – songs of the ABBA canon. Sure it’s a goof, but it’s a good goof. They have to perform “S.O.S.” on a sinking Titanic set, competing for screen time with Klein and some SNL writers pretending to drown in vintage dining-lounge attire.

You tell me it’s over, what more can I say? I’m no closer to figuring out the song’s mysteries – who is this “You”? (It should come as no surprise that Arthur later went on to make a record of Indian music with [Brimful of] Asha Bosle.) 2. Far, far better is this novelty ska take from Five Iron Frenzy. – Patrick Robbins, âI always thought that this song is about a sad teenager, standing at the window, watching his popular friends going out to parties, while heâs been left behind,â says Israeli singer-songwriter Nadev Dalumi. Their liner notes had a whiff of preemptive strike to them, saying the songs were “sometimes unbelievably corny, sometimes indigestibly syrupy, yet undeniably lasting.” They needn’t have worried – the bands, known and unknown alike, acquitted themselves well. – Mike Misch, When we were curating this list, more covers came from Australia’s Triple J “Like a Version” radio sessions than anywhere else. Still can’t abide the original, mind. I would like to hear more ABBA songs deconstructed in this way, certainly more than the tongue-in-cheek facsimiles offered so much by so many elsewhere. This is very much the case with ABBA’s smash hit “The Winner Takes It All.” Resisting the sentiment to play it straight, Carla Bruni walks the tightrope quite nicely in delivering a smoky, sultry rendition from her 2017 album, French Touch. True, the productions may be dated, and the outfits ridiculous, but at their core the songs are rock-solid. ALL and I mean ALL songs of ABBA!!! -ABBA, Hasta Manana. Cart.

Following a cover of the Kinksâ âWaterloo Sunset,â with Lucius guesting on backing vocals, singers Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig stuck around to take the lead on the similarly-titled âWaterloo,â because, as Jeff Tweedy noted, âwe really didnât want people to hear me sing this song.â The original, which was the winner of the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest – an accolade far bigger in Europe than it is here – was the beginning of ABBAâs international fame. – Seuras Og, In 2010, Wilco debuted the Solid Sound Festival, featuring music and comedy performances, at the MassMOCA art museum in North Adams, Massachusetts. All. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFJrAGv3_vg is a nice start.It’s simultaneously ironically self-referential and earnest. It makes the song more organic, more natural, and lifts it up – if not higher, then to its own very special place. Singer Tuva Lodmark comes across like the ghostly spectre of a disturbed ex-girlfriend as passively sings out: âAnd I’m possessive, it isn’t nice.â Be afraid of what you post on Facebook, because Pale Honey is definitely watching to make sure you âdon’t go wasting your emotionâ on anybody else.

This song scored a couple of places higher in the UK charts than the original, which gave me great joy, I recall. – Curtis Zimmermann, Nils Landgren brings on the funk with his distinctively different version of ABBA’s “Dancing Queen.” Enter it mid-song and the tune will be mostly unrecognizable. Turns up I’m not the only one to wonder: witness the 2017 Sydney Morning-Herald article “What made Australians the world’s most feverish Abba fans?” The answer never entirely clarifies, but the article does offer the wonderful scene of a nine-year old Nicole Kidman stalking the band at the Sydney airport. The Winner Takes It All might be my favourite; I’m a sucker for a sad song, but you can still dance to it. The four-track E.P. It’s not their fault.
