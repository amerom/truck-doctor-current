Armalite AR-10 Tactical. These rifles have been in the field in the hands of Alaskan guides for several years now without a single failure. I might fudge a teeny bit on power for effective follow-up shots, but not much. As mentioned, the upper port needs to be opened you can just see in my pic the forward portion of the port. The bear crumpled. Will I ever go back to World War I technology? Differences Between 450 Bushmaster And 458 Socom Power. Sig Sauer Romeo 5 Red Dot Sight Review – Should You Buy One. In this case, the 308 Winchester got another win. Unfortunately, getting closer was not an option. So began the trail that would lead to the founding of a firearms manufacturing company and a line of ammunition to go with the rifles: Alaska Magnum ARs, LLC. A client and I were hunting brown bears from one of my 16-foot aluminum skiffs. But are these really brown bear calibers? (l.) The .458 Socom uses metal .223 Rem. They were an immense help throughout the R&D phase of the project, supplying us with the raw materials needed all along the way. Like I said before, this was not an uncommon occurrence before switching to a “Better Bear Gun” but since the switch this scenario has not been replayed. SBR offers 16 different loads for the .458 SOCOM with bullets ranging from 140 to 500 grs. The .338 Federal is getting warmer. Fortunately for us, it was a bluebird day and looked to be staying that way for a while. If you are planning to build your first AR-15 chambered .458 SOCOM rifle, you have quite the project ahead of you.. RF, that is the best use of “SOCOM” since the 458. Our current go-to load is a 250-grain monolithic bullet travelling at well over 2,400 fps. Well, that could have gone better. We did just that. My wife Jana, full-time guide, Alaska Magnum ARs owner and bear killer in her own right, loves this combination. This ammunition has been designed and tested for target practice, hunting or defense. try this 6.5×47 LAPUA and 6.5 Creedmoor comparison here, What’s the Best Long Range Rifle Scope Under 1000? "So, as you can see, the SOCOM is maxed out at 125 yards and the HAM'R at 200 yards, which is a 75-yard gain in effective range with 2.5 inches less drop at 200 yards. This was the brown bear load I’d used for years and knew to be as reliable a bear killer as is possible. This is a brown bear caliber. The .308 is a good medium-game caliber. This is THE brown bear caliber. Not a lethal shot. With the client and his .340 Weatherby in a steady, prone position and my own bolt-action rifle on the same log the client was using, I used a rangefinder to pick out a landmark that the bear had to get to to be within my self-imposed 200-yard maximum range limit under this particular set of circumstances. Weak brass (.450 Bushmaster excepted) and a bolt face that has a marginal amount of material left was not a recipe for a powerful, high-intensity round capable of reliably killing large, dangerous game. Surely someone made a really effective AR with some real power? In a short, lightweight rifle, it gives one a sense of invincibility not afforded by many other rifle/cartridge combinations. Is it reliable? I remember the feel of the serrations on the rifle’s safety against my thumb. Although it is safe to claim that 450 SOCOM could smack a better bang inside 150 yards, it fails to stretch a distance up to 200 yards or beyond.

This wasn’t going to be easy. Ballistics of the SOCOM have been compared to the 45-70 except in a semi-auto AR-15 rifle. Still, no way was I deliberately choosing these calibers to chase 1,000-pound bears, especially not when they’re wounded and in the thick stuff. The Anvil's lugs are the same size as those found in a .308 because the case heads are the same size. Lights out. We could go a bit fatter with regard to case dimensions, but not too much longer than what was already out there. I knew the bear wasn’t dead, but I also knew that we could likely find him if we played our cards right and let him lie down. This means that the momentum of a rifle's reaction will exactly equal the momentum of the bullet and powder gasses ejected from the barrel. 450 Bushmaster vs 458 SOCOM vs 50 Beowulf: Ammunition Selection. We’d beached the skiff and unloaded ourselves and our gear about 700 yards from the bear and out of sight. No disrespect to the pistol shooting straight walled options. For instance, if the games are deers, the 450 is more than capable. (The .458 SOCOM is not included in this comparison, because its case is not straight walled.) For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction; that is one of the physical laws of our universe. My lower just happens to be from RRA because I wanted the caliber marked as 458 SOCOM rather than the Multi that all of mine are. The 458 SOCOM cartridge offers the practical ballistics of the legendary .45-70 in a modern AR platform rifle and is capable of firing 250 to 600 grain .458 caliber bullets in a lightweight, controllable package.

HAMR runs in an AR mag in a proprietary lower/upper/bcg. Check out. This is fine considering that, at least with regards to the SOCOM and Beowulf, we are dealing with what amounts to large pistol brass, which is inherently weaker than rifle brass. But if you are shooting at shorter distances and want to have more bullet energy, purchasing the 458 SOCOM is not a bad idea. I felt good about our position but not about the range. He now sells beautiful custom ARs mean enough to take down brown bears. Sure enough, the bear reached the stream, stared at it for a moment, then turned to his left and took a few steps toward the timber 30 yards away. Considering this was not an uncommon occurrence previously, I’d say this is no mean feat. .458 SOCOM (AR-15) 5.56 NATO .223 Wylde .223 Rem (AR-15) 6.5 Creedmoor (LR-308/AR-10) 6.5 Grendel (AR-15) 6.8 SPC (Ar-15) 7.62x39 (AR-15) 9mm (AR-15) 9x39mm (AR-15) 12.7x42 (.50 Beowulf) (AR-15) Calibers.223 Rem.223 Wylde / 5.56 NATO.224 Valkyrie.243 WIN.260 WIN.22 Nosler.300 Blackout.308 WIN.350 Legend.40 S&W.450 Bushmaster.458 Socom.45 ACP 6307 Arnold Dr, Austin, TX 78723 | Phone: +1 (512) 412-1014 | Email: Key Difference Between 308 Winchester & 458 SOCOM. So what did we come up with? No way, no how. I've always wanted to know how many hits steel can take from this BRUTAL bullet. You betcha! It's in all respects a modern 45-70 in a modern platform. While not a long-range caliber, it is grim death inside 200 yards; perhaps the quintessential “tracking wounded bears” gun. While the 308 Win usually takes about 600 to 800 yards before a bullet drop. With heavier bullet weights, the 458 can put more energy into any target at subsonic speeds compared to the 308 Winchester. Both cartridges offer a range of bullet grains shooting enthusiasts could choose from, depending on their specific hunting needs. JHP load and got 1,831 f.p.s. By staying just at the edge of the incredibly thick forest and hustling briskly, we were within about 300 yards of the bear as he started lumbering in our direction. I could easily come up with several that would not have made the trees had I been able to deliver more than one or two rushed back-up shots with a cumbersome bolt-action rifle. A SOCOM 458 usually drops at past 300 yards while the Winchester 308 could go beyond 1000 yards before hitting the zero drop. If you want a .458 SOCOM bolt made correctly and won’t cause you problems, get it from TROMIX. Hence, it will spend less time in the barrel, causing it to have less recoil. This brought back memories of other bears I’d had to track — and you know what? As the acronym implies (Special Operations Command), members of special operations units were unhappy with the 5.56 rounds ability to bring down the enemy quickly and with as few shots as possible in combat while using platforms such as the M4 and M16.After deliberations and experimentation, the .458 SOCOM came to be in the early 2000’s. With myself in the lead with my open-sighted 16-inch-barrel .375 tracking gun and an assistant guide at my back, we tracked the bear through the patchy snow and thick forest for a couple of hours. The .375 was chosen for a few specific reasons:.375 is the minimum caliber allowed for dangerous game in Tanzania and Botswana. It was unlikely he would continue beyond that point because the kelp didn’t continue to our side of the stream. Regardless, 458 SOCOM and 458 HAMR are two different rounds. An AR-10 type rifle that fires a 260-grain bullet at 2,600 fps from a 22-inch barrel? If you don't want to bring your iPad into the bathroom, we can send you a magazine subscription for free!

The .458 SOCOM and .50 Beowulf are not SAAMI certified and no major ammunition companies produce ammo for them. And although the 308 could stomp over the 458 SOCOM in the distance, the 458 would stomp on the 308 for bullet weight and will take down just about any target you wish to hunt. Eventually, I could see where the bear had crossed a pretty good-sized open stretch of snow, maybe 25 yards across. Fortunately, we found a good starting point thanks to our good friends over at Hornady. The .338 Federal is getting warmer.

As the bear stood on his hind legs, twisted and bit at his shoulder, I shouted, “Shoot him again” and got the best shot off I could. The client fired and missed while I racked the bolt, hurriedly got the running bear back in the scope, and sent one into his hind end as he disappeared into the forest. Many Somalis would chew the drug Khat  all day and the effects of the drugwould both curb their appetite (in a country plagued by famine) and inc… A small stream was 175 yards ahead. The shell of 308 is relatively short, making it well adapted to quick action rifles. The answer was two-fold: Base the AR-15 caliber on the same heavy-duty brass we’d developed and proven in the AR-10 type platform, and redesign the bolt, carrier and barrel extensions to handle the increased pressures and bolt thrust of the new round. Opening the bolt face up to accept the rim diameters of the current crop of big-bore cartridges leaves very little material left, making for an operating system that cannot be pushed hard. As I raised my rifle, the bear’s eyes shifted slightly from me to the guide just behind me. With this, the 458 SOCOM takes another win. The question is are you a modern guy or a classic western guy? But are these really brown bear calibers?
