The objects in the set are called its elements. Nested Arrays. Updated: Apr 4, 2013. Electric Current is defined as the rate of flow of charge carrier (Q) per unit time (t). From essential elements to kinds to … For each element, the entry in the periodic table shows its chemical symbol , its atomic mass (AKA its mass number ) which is the larger number, and its atomic number (AKA its proton number ) which is the smaller number. An Introduction to Atoms Matter (stuff) is made of atoms. The atom is never broken down into smaller particles in chemical reactions. This introduction involves using a short list of at least three items that have something in common.
