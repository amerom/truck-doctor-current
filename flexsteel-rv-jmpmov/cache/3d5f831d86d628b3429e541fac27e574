Global carbon emissions from using fossil fuels fell by a record amount in 2020 as a result of Covid-19 lockdowns around the world, researchers have said. This week’s chart uses the most recent data from Global Carbon Atlas to demonstrate where most of the world’s CO₂ emissions come from, sorted by country. However, that has come down from 40.1 billion US tons in the year 2019. “The Global Carbon Project provides a valuable annual resource, meticulously accounting for the CO2 emitted from human activities and its ultimate fate; whether it ends up in the ocean, the biosphere, or remains in the atmosphere where it influences climate change. 2 To set the scene, let’s look at how the planet has warmed. Carbon dioxide emissions in 2020 fell by 7%, the biggest drop ever, as countries around the world imposed lockdowns and restrictions on movement to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, the Global Carbon Project said in its annual assessment on Friday. These are the findings we show in the 15th global carbon budget, an annual report card of the Global Carbon Project on the sources and removals of carbon dioxide, the primary driver of human-caused climate change. The analyses employed baseline emissions by country for the latest year available (2018 or 2019) from the Global Carbon Budget 2019 to estimate absolute daily emission changes and covered 67 countries representing 97 % of global emissions. Global carbon emissions from using fossil fuels fell by a record amount in 2020 as a result of Covid-19 lockdowns around the world, researchers have said. A locked-down, pandemic-struck world cut its carbon dioxide emissions this year by 7%, the biggest drop ever, new preliminary figures show. This year’s emissions decline is more than four times larger. The report … A decline in transportation activity drove the global drop in carbon emissions.
