The Pittsburgh Sleep Diary (PghSD) is an … Finally, researchers have used various definitions and different calculations for indices such as SE and WASO (including or not including the final awakening), the primary measures of interest in many insomnia clinical trials. Center for Sleep & Circadian Science Department of Psychiatry University of Pittsburgh 3811 O’Hara Street Pittsburgh, PA 15213. Before going to bed and again on awaking in the morning, they initiated the electronic diary by tapping lightly on the button. Psychology Tools creates resources to improve your therapy and save you time. What if something unusual affects my sleep or how I feel in the daytime? The first four questions of the questionnaire were Likert scale items (rated from 0 = not at all understandable to 3 = very understandable) that asked: (1) Are the instructions clear? Please check for further notifications by email. Put the letter “C” in the box when you have coffee, cola or tea. Items deemed essential were included in a Core sleep diary… The consensus sleep diary project was an outgrowth of the 2005 Insomnia Assessment Conference which resulted in a publication with recommendations for standard research … Learn more about the Consensus Sleep Diary. In the sleep diary, the word “day” is the time when you choose or are required to be awake. Abstract. Each diary entry is time-stamped for the time data was entered. The focus group data also suggested that many individuals prefer alternative formats for sleep data representation (clock faces, time lines). The diary is provided free for not-for-profit use. The data were summarized into themes and changes to the drafts were made in response to the focus groups. 4. The Consensus Sleep Diary was developed in 2012 by a collaboration of insomnia experts. The proposed diary is intended as a living document which still needs to be tested, refined, and validated. Previous research on focus groups suggested that obtaining participant input via methods such as focus groups is a crucial component of developing patient reported outcomes (PRO).11,12 Focus groups were therefore conducted to evaluate the core and expanded CSD to ensure that the PRO items actually measured the constructs and phenomena relevant to the insomnia patient or subject. Sleep deprivation can contribute to moodiness, high blood pressure, poor concentration, the prolongation of mental illness, work difficulties, auto accidents, and more. A consensus sleep diary, based on input from a large group of insomnia experts and on focus groups of individuals with and without sleep disorders, was developed. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR PATIENT What is a Sleep Diary? Research use requires permission from the first author. The questions ask about: (1) the time of getting into bed; (2) the time at which the individual attempted to fall asleep; (3) sleep onset latency; (4) number of awakenings; (5) duration of awakenings; (6) time of final awakening; (7) final rise time; (8) perceived sleep quality (rated via Likert scale); and (9) an additional space for open-ended comments from the respondent. What time did you try to go to sleep? Results showed that the CSD indices differentiated good sleepers from those with insomnia and were associated with similar objective … Bedtime components relate to the events of the day preceding the sleep, waketime components to the sleep period just completed. Although the results of focus groups can be described in quantitative terms, they are best viewed as hypothesis-generating rather than hypothesis-testing procedures.15–17. How many times did you wake up, not : counting your final awakening? METHODS. The specific aims of this work-group were to: (1) review the range and nature of sleep diaries previously used in insomnia research; (2) solicit diaries currently used from a large group of insomnia researchers; (3) identify commonalities in previously used sleep diaries and integrate those commonalities into a consensus instrument; (4) solicit critical input about the resultant consensus sleep diary from a wide range of insomnia researchers; (5) conduct qualitative field testing with patients to acquire additional information to be used for refining the diary instrument and its associated instructional set; and (6) conduct preliminary lexical analyses on the reading level required for the measure. Following a scripted introduction explaining the purpose of sleep diaries, each focus group was asked a set of structured questions designed to elicit descriptions of sleep and daytime activities and events related to sleep. However, because sleep is known to be highly variable across nights, it may violate the constancy (i.e., temporal stability) assumption of test-retest reliability.21 A valid assessment of test-retest reliability for a sleep diary would likely require many nights to overcome the problem of instability in sleep itself.22 Other reliability indices assess the internal consistency of the measure; however, the sleep diary is not intended to measure one construct, and items are not expected to correlate with one another (e.g., there is no reason to expect that bed time would correlate with number of awakenings). Finally, each group was shown the proposed sleep diary, and asked for their comments regarding its utility, format, and adequacy for describing their sleep. This is not usually a problem. In general, focus groups consist of small groups of people who are asked in general terms about their perceptions, opinions, beliefs, and attitudes towards methods for evaluating the construct in question. Carney CE et al. 3 times 5. The Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD) is a standardized, prospective tool for tracking nightly subjective sleep. Three members did not respond to multiple contact attempts. Beyond the consensus core items, a variety of optional items were proposed, reflecting the varying aims and constraints of research studies, the different contexts in which the diary was anticipated to see application, and the specific preferences of individual investigators. Advantages of the CSD in particular include the use of both expert consensus and qualitative patient input, as recommended for development of reliable and valid patient-report instruments.20 This methodology included collecting and incorporating diaries currently in use in the field, consensus group editing and composing of items, employing focus groups to solicit input of subjects/patients both for diary development and for editing, solicitation of feedback from experts in the insomnia research community, and carrying out lexile analysis. The subject will record what time they got into bed, time they went to sleep, how long to fall asleep, how many times they woke up, time they finally woke up, time they got out of bed, rate the quality of sleep… Members were also permitted to suggest new wording if no choices were desirable. Record your sleep each morning. STUDY OBJECTIVES To present an expert consensus, standardized, patient-informed sleep diary. Insomnia is a very prevalent and significant sleep disorder associated with reduced quality of life, increased healthcare costs, and increased risks for serious psychiatric and medical comorbidities.2,3 Over the past four decades, a bourgeoning body of research has focused on the epidemiology, causes, consequences, and treatment of this condition.
