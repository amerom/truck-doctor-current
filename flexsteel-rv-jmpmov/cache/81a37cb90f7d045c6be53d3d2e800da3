For a grade of 3 the patient should be able to actively extend the knee from 90o of flexion without a swinging motion secondary to flexing the knee and creating momentum[2]. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine intertester reliability of the AKET and the PKET in patients with acute hamstring injuries extend the patient's knee from a flexed position; maltracking noted if patella is laterally displacing in full extension; patella grind test . Description: The athlete is lying supine with hip flexed to 90° while the clinician is fixating the untested leg.
