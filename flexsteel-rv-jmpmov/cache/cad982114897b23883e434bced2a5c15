In psychology, a drive theory, theory of drives or drive doctrine[1] is a theory that attempts to analyze, classify or define  the psychological drives. This in turn leads to individual manifesting behaviors, which serve as dominant responses. Drive Reduction Theory was developed by the psychologist Clark Hull in 1943, as the first theory for motivation. [6] In 1927, Sigmund Freud said that a drive theory was what was lacking most in psychoanalysis. First: Freud was an MD, and started his career as a neurologist, before developing his seminal theories of psychoanalysis. In the end, the author conceptualizes drive theory and attachment theory as building on one another rather than as being mutually exclusive or otherwise contradicting each other. In 1943 two psychologists, Clark Hull and Kenneth Spence, had the first interest in this idea of motivation. Freud identified ‘instincts’ or ‘drives’ (Triebe) that he viewed as innate, universal and constantly felt.

These drives are ‘mental representations of unspecified nervous system excitation related in some way to sexual and aggressive urges.’ The individual seeks to satisfy these urges so that he can return to the homeostatic state. Freud based his theory on the main drives of sex and aggression that dominate our lives. Drive theory is consequently also known as Drive Reduction Theory.

Before introducing the death drive into his theory, Freud’s fundamental opposition was between the ego drives (Ichtriebe) and the sexual drives (Sexualtriebe), a differentiation that is founded on the two-fold role of each individual being. But is the death drive as negative as it sounds? In classical Freudian psychoanalytic theory, the death drive (German: Todestrieb) is the drive toward death and destruction, often expressed through behaviors such as aggression, repetition compulsion, and self-destructiveness. Sigmund Freud's "Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality", written in 1905, attempted to trace the course of the development of the sexual instinct in human beings from infancy to maturity.

In the presence of a passive audience, an individual is in a heightened state of arousal. Even though Freud described drives as reactions to certain stimuli, he, ironically, studied it in isolation. When a need is satisfied, drive is reduced and the organism returns to a state of homeostasis and relaxation. Throughout his work and as he advanced in the formulation of his theory Freud considered the existence of another type of drive contrary to the first that explains a part of the human psyche Eros fails to close. For many years,Freud’s “theory of drives” – he himself spoke of “Trieblehre1” (Freud, 1905a,b, 1914a,b, 1920b) – endeavored to do this.
