So everything under the template key is a regular pod specification. Rollback to an … Falling back to DNSDefault policy. Kubernetes Deployment Yaml Example To deploy containerized applications in Kubernetes cluster we use Kubernetes Deployment. After a few seconds, you should see the pods running: From here, you can test out the Pod (just as we did in the previous article), but ultimately we want to create a Kubernetes Deployment example, so let’s go ahead and delete it so there aren’t any name conflicts: Sometimes, of course, things don’t go as you expect. To start, you need a deployment which specifies which image to use (the one you pushed to the registry earlier). You can nest these as far as you want to. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler automatically scales the number of pods in a replication controller, deployment, replica set or stateful set based on observed CPU utilization (or, with beta support, on some other, application-provided metrics). This object is responsible for creating the pods, and ensuring there are running. We’ll start, in this case, by saying that whatever Pods we deploy, we always want to have 2 replicas. Today we will see Kubernetes deployment yaml example. A reference repository of YAML with canonical and as-simple-as-possible demonstrations of kubernetes functionality and features. You can also specify even deeper information, such as the location of the container’s exit log. "Mirantis" and "FUEL" are registered trademarks of Mirantis, Inc. All other trademarks are the property of their respective owners. Maintained Examples are expected to be updated with every Kubernetes release, to use the latest and greatest features, current guidelines and best practices, and to refresh command syntax, output, changed prerequisites, as needed. On the other hand, that’s not very likely, unfortunately. This is interesting. At Container Solutions we find we regularly need chunks of YAML to demonstrate something specific, such as: A simple deployment. You can find a full list of the, Now let’s go ahead and create the deployment.         – containerPort: 88, Taking it apart one piece at a time, we start with the API version; here it’s just v1. From there, as you can see, we have two values. You can also specify more complex properties, such as a command to run when the container starts, arguments it should use, a working directory, or whether to pull a new copy of the image every time it’s instantiated. Create PersistentVolumeClaims and PersistentVolumes. You can also specify more complex properties, such as a command to run when the container starts, arguments it should use, a working directory, or whether to pull a new copy of the image every time it’s instantiated. You can customise the message displayed by the hello-kubernetes container. , that has as its value a map with 2 more keys. Declare the new state of the Podsby updating the PodTemplateSpec of the Deployment. The labels key itself has a map as its value. ... python / examples / nginx-deployment.yaml Go to file Go to file T; Go to line L; Copy path micw523 Deprecate extensions/v1beta1 deployment. This document walks you through an example of enabling Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for the php-apache server. For example, are at the same indentation level, so the processor knows they’re both part of the same map; it knows that, "args": ["sleep", "1000", "message", "Bring back Firefly! The first step, of course, is to go ahead and create a text file locally. In this case, the deployment will create pods that run nginx-hostname and with the configured labels. So we might start our Deployment definition like this: Here we’re specifying the apiVersion as extensions/v1beta1 — remember, Deployments aren’t in v1, as Pods were — and that we want a Deployment. (When we get to deployments, we’ll have to specify a different version because Deployments don’t exist in v1.). The, property includes any containers, memory requirements, storage volumes, Network or other details that Kubernetes needs to know about, as well as properties such as whether to restart the container if it fails. We’ll start, in this case, by saying that whatever Pods we deploy, we always want to have 2 replicas. wordpress-deployment.yaml. Examples of Kubernetes Deployment. The spec property includes any containers, memory requirements, storage volumes, Network or other details that Kubernetes needs to know about, as well as properties such as whether to restart the container if it fails. ). Watch a recording of author Nick Chase in a webinar on YAML. Each list item under ports is itself a map that lists the containerPort and its value. They just go together really nicely! For example, this YAML file describes a Deployment that runs the nginx:1.14.2 Docker image: The ReplicaSet creates Pods in the background. Among the features that we will discuss in more depth are configuration files and labels.       ports: In this example I’ve used 2 spaces for readability, but the number of spaces doesn’t matter — as long as it’s at least 1, and as long as you’re CONSISTENT. The following are typical use cases for Deployments: 1. To deploy and access your application through a port, you need three YAML files. So if we were to translate this to JSON, it would look like this: YAML lists are literally a sequence of objects. , but in general, this is all you need to get started. The deployment process for Kubernetes deployments is driven by a controller loop, in contrast to deployment configurations which use deployer pods for every new rollout. Here are the, The first step, of course, is to go ahead and create a text file locally. This Kubernetes deployment tutorial guide will explain the key concepts in a Kubernetes YAML specification with an Nginx example deployment. YAML, which stands for Yet Another Markup Language, or YAML Ain’t Markup Language (depending who you ask) is a human-readable text-based format for specifying configuration-type information. We’re going to be tackling a great deal of Kubernetes-related content in the coming months, so if there’s something specific you want to hear about, let us know in the comments, or tweet us at @MirantisIT. Few of them are listed below. To rollout a RS. Maintained Examples. You can see that if you ask for a list of the pods: If you check early enough, while K8s is still deploying, you can see that the workload is still being created. So we might start our Deployment definition like this: Please note: Mirantis has realigned its portfolio and renamed several products. For example, in this article, we’ll pick apart the YAML definitions for creating first a Pod, and then a Deployment. Here’s some YAML that you can use as a template for creating your deployments. Next we specify the metadata. A new ReplicaSet is created and the Deployment manages moving the Pods from the old ReplicaSet to the new one at a controlled rate. That’s not to say there aren’t more complex things you can do, but in general, this is all you need to get started. We can also specify any other metadata we want, but let’s keep things simple for now. Even if you’re only trying to find examples on the web, they’re most likely in (non-JSON) YAML, so we might as well get used to it. to spin up resources. This kind of thing is pretty simple, of course, and you can think of it in terms of its JSON equivalent: Notice that in our YAML version, the quotation marks are optional; the processor can tell that you’re looking at a string based on the formatting. For completeness, let’s quickly look at the JSON equivalent: {  “apiVersion”: “v1”,  “kind”: “Pod”,  “metadata”: {  “name”: “rss-site”,  “labels”: {  “app”: “web”  }  },  “spec”: {  “containers”: [{  “name”: “front-end”,  “image”: “nginx”,  “ports”: [{  “containerPort”: “80”  }]  }, {  “name”: “rss-reader”,  “image”: “nickchase/rss-php-nginx:v1”,  “ports”: [{  “containerPort”: “88”  }]  }]  } }. object in Kubernetes that lets you manage a set of identical pods   containers: Each list item under, maps, which are groups of name-value pairs, If you haven’t set up your cluster and kubectl, go ahead and check out this, In our previous example, we described a simple Pod using YAML, Finally, we’ll configure the actual objects that make up the pod. The deployment takes care of everything else. Next, we’re specifying that we want to create a Pod; we might specify instead a Deployment, Job, Service, and so on, depending on what we’re trying to achieve. We’re going to be tackling a great deal of Kubernetes-related content in the coming months, so if there’s something specific you want to hear about, let us know in the comments, or tweet us at.     – name: rss-reader Let’s start with a Pod. YAML is the most convenient way to work with Kubernetes objects, and in this article we looked at creating Pods and Deployments. To fix the problem, I first deleted the Pod, then fixed the YAML file and started again. You might have maps of lists and lists of maps, and so on, but if you’ve got those two structures down, you’re all set. At the lowest level, much of the Kubernetes configuration is through YAML. You might have maps of lists and lists of maps, and so on, but if you’ve got those two structures down, you’re all set. Our product names have changed. Create a Deployment to rollout a ReplicaSet. The YAML processor knows how all of these pieces relate to each other because we’ve indented the lines. The value you provide will be displayed as the custom message. ), but ultimately we want to create a Kubernetes Deployment example, so let’s go ahead and delete it so there aren’t any name conflicts: NAME       READY     STATUS         RESTARTS   AGE, Start Time:     Sun, 08 Jan 2017 08:36:47 +0000, Container ID:               docker://a42edaa6dfbfdf161f3df5bc6af05e740b97fd9ac3d35317a6dcda77b0310759, Image ID:                   docker://sha256:01f818af747d88b4ebca7cdabd0c581e406e0e790be72678d257735fad84a15f, Started:                  Sun, 08 Jan 2017 08:36:49 +0000, Image:                      nickchase/rss-php-nginx, FirstSeen     LastSeen        Count   From                    SubobjectPath  Type             Reason                  Message, ---------     --------        -----   ----                    -------------  -------- ------                  -------, 45s           45s             1       {default-scheduler }                   Normal           Scheduled               Successfully assigned rss-site to 10.0.10.7, 44s           44s             1       {kubelet 10.0.10.7}     spec.containers{front-end}      Normal          Pulling                 pulling image "nginx". Kubernetes tutorials, product updates and featured articles, (UPDATE:  The code in this article has been updated to reflect changes in more recent versions of Kubernetes.). OK, so now that we know we want 2 replicas, we need to answer the question: “Replicas of what?”  They’re defined by templates: Look familiar? Next we specify the name. Templates are simply definitions of objects to be replicated — objects that might, in other circumstances, by created on their own. 2. (Scroll down for code that can be copy-and-pasted. Without a deployment, you’d need to create, update, and delete a bunch of pods manually. Kubernetes, remember, manages container-based resources. This example consists of the following components: A single-instance Redis master to store guestbook entries; Multiple replicated Redis instances to serve reads In this example I’ve used 2 spaces for readability, but the number of spaces doesn’t matter — as long as it’s at least 1, and as long as you’re CONSISTENT. In the following example my application consist of a 010-deployment.yaml and a 020-service ... for defining resource objects in Kubernetes.       image: nickchase/rss-php-nginx:v1 Kubernetes deployments by example A deployment is a supervisor for pods , giving you fine-grained control over how and when a new pod version is rolled out as well as rolled back to a previous state. Create a Deployment based on the YAML file:kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/deployment.yaml 2. What’s the difference between a deployment and a service? Now let’s go ahead and create the deployment. You can get more information on running (or should-be-running) objects by asking Kubernetes to, So that’s our basic YAML tutorial. So on the one hand, if you know JSON and you’re only ever going to write your own YAML (as opposed to reading other people’s) you’re all set. The main purpose of the deployment object is to maintain the resources declared in the deployment configuration in its desired state. Removing old Pods or RS that are not needed. Here we’re specifying the name of the Pod, as well as the label we’ll use to identify the pod to Kubernetes. YAML Configuration File is the main tool for creating and configuring components in the Kubernetes cluster. Check the status of the rollout to see if it succeeds or not. Organizing resource configurations Many applications require multiple resources to be created, such as a Deployment and a Service. Kubernetes provides a number of tools to help you manage your application deployment, including scaling and updating. role_binding.yaml. MySQL and Wordpress each require a PersistentVolume to store data. For example, you might have a config file that starts like this: The first line is a separator, and is optional unless you’re trying to define multiple structures in a single file. Both services and deployments choose which pods they operate on using labels and label selectors. In this article, you will get an explanation of Docker and Kubernetes, and you will build an example NodeJS web application and deploy it using both technologies. For example, name and labels are at the same indentation level, so the processor knows they’re both part of the same map; it knows that app is a value for labels because it’s indented further. A new ReplicaSet is created and the Deployment manages moving the Pods from the old ReplicaSet to the new one at a controlled rate.     app: web Of these, only the name is really required, but in general, if you want it to do anything useful, you’ll need more information. . Next, we use a label selector to tell the deployment which pods are part of the deployment.       image: nginx First, take a look at the animation that annotates each section of the deployment YAML. Pause the Deployment to apply multiple fixes in YAML file and then resume to start new rollout.
