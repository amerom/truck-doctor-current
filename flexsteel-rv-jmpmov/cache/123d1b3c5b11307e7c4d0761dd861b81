The adult human skeleton is made up of 206 bones, and is divided into two main divisions: the axial and appendicular. The appendicular skeleton includes the extremities and the limb girdles as shown in Fig. Throughout development, the eight separate plates of the immature bones join collectively into one single structure identified as the Skull. […]  Unlike the axial skeleton, the appendicular skeleton is unfused. The bones that attach each upper limb to the axial skeleton form the pectoral girdle (shoulder girdle). The skeletal system in vertebrates is divided into the axial skeleton (which consists of the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage), and the appendicular skeleton (which consists of the shoulders, limb bones, the pectoral girdle, and the pelvic girdle).

Total number of Bones: Axial Skeleton consists of … Vomer How Are Bones Classified? The bones of the appendicular skeleton (the limbs and girdles) “append” to the axial skeleton. The axial skeleton forms the central axis of the human body and is composed of 80 bones that include the bones of the skull, the ossicles of the middle ear, the hyoid bone of the throat, the vertebral column, and the thoracic cage. The Human Skeleton can be divided up into two parts, the axial Skeleton, and the appendicular skeleton. The appendicular skeleton consists of 126 bones.63 bones on each side. The human skeletal system is divided into two principal subdivisions: the axial and appendicular skeleton. The vertebral column consists of 5 parts. Frontal The Human Skeleton can be divided up into two parts, the axial skeleton which is the central core of the body and the appendicular skeleton which forms the extremities of the arms and legs. Occipital The axial skeleton is composed of the skull, the ossicles of the middle ear, the vertebral column consisting of a total of 80 bones, hyoid, rib cage, and sternum while the appendicular skeleton is composed of pectoral girdles, arms, forearms, hands, pelvis, legs, feet, and ankles. The 80 bones of the axial skeleton form the vertical axis of the body. The sacrum, made from 5 fused vertebrae and the coccyx, made from 3-5 fused vertebrae. Bones in the axial and appendicular skeletons exhibit heterogeneous growth patterns between different ethnic and sex groups. What Is The Difference Between Interstitial And Appositional Growth?IX. 26 bones in the vertebral column (24 vertebrae, the sacrum, and the coccyx) 2 Inferior nasal conchae. The length of each rib extends from number one to seven and then declines pair number 12. The axial skeleton consists of four types of vertebrae (Figure 5.4).Most anteriorly is a single cervical vertebra, the atlas, that articulates with the occipital condyles of the skull.In addition to this set of articulations is another: the anteroventral process of the atlas (the odontoid process) projects into the foramen magnum and articulates with the lateral margins of the foramen. The rib cage protects the vital organs such as the heart and lungs. This central part of your body contains the axial skeleton, or the bones lying along a central axis, or midline, of your body. 2 Palatine bones Bones help to withstand stress and greater loads on the skelet… The rib cage is comprised of 12 pairs of ribs and the sternum.
