The crude oil loading and transport systems include oil lines from the platform to two offshore tanker loading stations. Gannet is an oil and gas field located in the United Kingdom’s continental shelf in the North Sea. The firm has delivered vertical and horizontal infrastructure projects from 16 offices across North America. 189-190. Prior to the Hibernia project, Bull Arm was a "greenfield" site with little local supporting infrastructure. [1], Many of the topsides modules were constructed locally, with some sourced internationally. PROJECT SCOPE Develop a Design Basis Memorandum, preliminary conceptual design, and cost estimate for an offshore Gravity Based Structure (GBS) for the extraction of Natural ... HIBERNIA Structure … Many oil platforms will also contain facilities to accommodate their workforce. This basin formed in response to the large scale plate tectonic forces that ripped apart the super-continent Pangea and also led to sea-floor spreading in the North Atlantic Ocean. Hibernia crude oil is produced from the first gravity base structure (GBS) designed to resist icebergs. Hibernia.ca; Terra Nova. The chances of an iceberg hitting the Hibernia gravity base structure are slim - but still possible. The field began oil production from a Gravity Base Structure platform on November 17, 1997. In addition, unusual design situations resulted from the construction methods and the structural components used. It has been widely reported that the Hibernia Platform has been installed during Summer 1997 at its final operation site, 315 km offshore Newfoundland. Media in category "Hibernia Gravity Base Structure" The following 2 files are in this category, out of 2 total. The Hibernia consortium studied the feasibility of applying this new technology to the project. 12510 Belford Ave Bldg 2 Englewood, CO, 80112. At the time it weighed 120,000 Mg (132,300 ton). Jeanne d'Arc" on out-dated bathymetric charts and which was once thought to represent a local exposure of basement rocks similar to the Virgin Rocks. The Magnus oilfield is a large oilfield in the United Kingdom's zone of North Sea. The platform was towed to its final site, and 450,000 tonnes of solid ballast were added to secure it in place. PROJECT SCOPE Develop a Design Basis Memorandum, preliminary conceptual design, and cost estimate for an offshore Gravity Based Structure (GBS) for the extraction of Natural ... HIBERNIA Structure Height: 224m A common application for a GBS is an offshore oil platform." The platform was towed to its final site, and 450,000 tonnes of solid ballast were added to secure it in place. The province also includes over seven thousand small islands. Hibernia’s novel 450,000t gravity-base structure design consists of a 105.5m concrete caisson, constructed using high-strength concrete reinforced with steel rods and pre-stressed tendons. Figure 3: Gravity Base Structure (CBS), Hibernia Platform (“Hibernia, Canada”, 2012) 2.3 Offshore Loading System The OLS is a crude oil transmission system, which transfers the crude oil from the GBS to the ice resisting tankers. THE GRAVITY BASE STRUCTURE The GBS design was selected for the Hibernia project in 1985. The Gannet A installation is the host platform for subsea tiebacks designated Gannet B to G. Like most Shell fields in the central and northern North Sea the field is named after a sea bird the gannet. 8.5.3.1 Hibernia gravity base structure The Hibernia gravity base structure was designed using HPC made with a Type 10 SF cement (Type 1 ASTM cement containing 7%–8% silica fume) and a polynaphthalene superplasticizer, in order to resist the impact of huge icebergs ( Hoff & Elimov, 1995; Woodhead, 1993 ). Canada's early petroleum discoveries took place near population centres or along lines of penetration into the frontier. The Terra Nova field is operated by Suncor Energy Inc., with a 37.675% interest. Hibernia Gravity-Based Production Structure Offshore Newfoundland, Canada BergerABAM was retained to provide senior-level technical support to the Hibernia Project Task Force charged with monitoring and reviewing the design of this iceberg-resistant, gravity-based oil production structure. For many reasons, the operators of the field, first MOBIL OIL CANADA, then HMDC (Hibernia Management & Development Company), selected the fixed Gravity Base Structure option (GBS). It is 180 km (110 mi) east of Aberdeen, and the water depth at the Gannet offshore installation is 95 m (312 ft). The 117,000 metric ton gravity base for the Hibernia oil field development project off Newfoundland has been floated without leaks. It also builds tankers, cargo bulk carriers, passenger ships and ferries. The Strait of Belle Isle separates the province into two geographical divisions, Labrador and the island of Newfoundland.
