Earth is made up of several layers. Seismic evidence suggests that there is also some molten material at this depth (perhaps about 10%). 1 : a theory in geology: the lithosphere of the earth is divided into a small number of plates which float on and travel independently over the mantle and much of the earth's seismic activity occurs at the boundaries of these plates. This relatively cool and rigid section of Earth is believed to "float" on top of the warmer, non-rigid, and partially melted material directly below.

This motion of the lithospheric plates is known as plate tectonics , and is responsible for many of the movements seen on Earth's surface today including earthquakes, certain types of volcanic activity, and continental drift. This layer is called the upper part of the upper mantle, and varies in depth from about 31–62 mi (50–100 km) below Earth's surface.  Subject: Science Below the lithosphere, the temperature is believed to reach 1,832°F (1,000°C), which is warm enough to allow rock material to flow if pressurized.
