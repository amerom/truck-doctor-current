For instance, an El Niño event in 1997-1998 warmed surface waters in the central Pacific by ~2-3°F above the long-term average temperature. The Cultural Effects of Coral Bleaching Located in warm, shallow waters, one species is near itâs extinction. When coral reefs turn deathly white as ocean temperatures spike, the kaleidoscope of marine life surrounding them dims as well, becoming more functionally monochromatic and less ecologically diverse, according to researchers who studied a section of the Great Barrier Reef before, during, and after a catastrophic coral bleaching event in 2016.  The Reef needs our help while thereâs still time. âCoral bleaching is a leading cause of coral death around the world,â said Iliana Baums, professor of biology at Penn State and an author of the paper. In this weakened state, coral becomes more susceptible to diseases. Climate change is the biggest threat to our Great Barrier Reef. Gorgeous, delicate coral reefs are home to millions of fish and fundamental to our own survival. Scientific studies has anticipated this for years, but many people do not understand the _damage this obsolescence would have on the environment. Human-caused climate change is causing an "utter tragedy" to one of the world's largest coral reef systems, according to Australian researchers. Coral bleaching occurs when zooxanthellae â the symbiotic algae that provide coral polyps with nutrients and their color â are lost from coral tissues. âIt is a direct consequence of increasing water temperatures. During bleaching, the coral expels its algal partners that live within the coral tissue. Coral reefs function like oases in a desert, providing food and shelter for marine life. Coral bleaching is a global crisis, caused by increased ocean temperatures driven by carbon pollution. Repeat coral bleaching caused by rising sea temperatures has resulted in lasting changes to fish communities, according to a new long-term study in the Seychelles. âCoral bleaching is caused by global warming, full stop,â said Terry Hughes, lead author of a new study on coral bleaching. The researchers found that bleaching events have increased from one every 25 to 30 years in the early 1980s to an average of one every six years since 2010. Severe or extended bleaching events ultimately result in coral mortality. Coral reefs thrive in warm, shallow waters that provide shelter for many different forms of bacteria, fungi, seaweeds, reptiles, mammals, crustaceans and over 4,000 species of fish. This additional stressor results in decreased reproduction and growth. Coral bleaching events in the past have occurred when waters got too warm for too long. When algae is expelled from coral, the coral loses its color and begins to starve. What Are The Effects of Coral Bleaching?
