According to the latest global environment performance index ranking Pakistan is in the list of countries which suffer from poor air quality. Time to time, waste generation rate is increasing and creating lot of problems for the residents of Islamabad including health problems, aesthetic problems and also pollution which is on the top of all the problems. In various regions of Pakistan, the Cu concentration in soil and dust ranges from <6 to 412 mg/kg (Table 2), where contaminated site from Kohistan region reported the highest content of Cu in soil . BRIEF OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS-PAKISTAN SCENARIO Pakistan is a country of 131 million populations with per capita income of US $ 488 and GDP of Rs. In a survey conducted by Farooq-e-Azam it is reported that the range of soil carbon in Pakistan soils is 0.52 to 1.38% in different soil series. Most of the land is lying unused due to this problem. It remains by far the largest employer, absorbing 45% of the country's total labor force. Pakistan’s Afghan problem ... there have been repeated skirmishes through history on the border between the two nations and Afghan soil … They are … Therefore, the fertility of soil is decreasing day by day. 8.4 % was seen in the medium scale industry. In a survey conducted by Farooq-e-Azam it is reported that the range of soil carbon in Pakistan soils is 0.52 to 1.38% in different soil series. Soil structure in Pakistan. 3. PTI. The soil survey of Pakistan has surveyed about 715,000 square kilometres of land, covering about 81% of the total area of the country. The major aspect of soil degradation includes poor soil fertility, soil salinity, water logging, and soil erosion, and soil contamination, scarcity of essential minerals and steadily depletion of organic matter contents. Soil salinity is one of the major issues in the agriculture sector of Pakistan. However, raising crops on problem soils such as water logged, salt affected, wind and water eroded is a matter of great concern. that make it useless for a given use. Soil salinity and sodicity occur naturally in semi-arid to arid regions. A soil having 1.29 % C is considered to be sufficient in organic matter, but Pakistan soils are having less than that. Characterization of Eroded Lands of Pothwar Plateau, Punjab, Pakistan. This paper discusses the problems and potentials of Pakistan's agriculture. Following are the major causes of agricultural problems in Pakistan which disturb the agricultural growth or development in Pakistan. 1. There are two seasons for growing crops in Pakistan. Module at a glance: Topic You will learn Problem soils - The significance of water table levels - About expansive soils - About collapsible soils But through soil exhaustion and ruin, they changed to their present barren state. Water logging and salinity are two of The formation of structure is inhibited in many areas of Pakistan. How different soil types behave and why this causes problems for builders. Owing to the growing population, expansion of the economic sector, urbanization, poor waste management and a number of other factors, the environmental problems in Pakistan are getting worse with each passing. These are some of the major environmental concerns in Pakistan that you should know about. Firstly,No mechanism has been adopted to eradicate the soil erosion and even after harvesting nothing is done to improve or restore the soil energy. In these areas the moisture required for structure forma- tion is obtained mainly from river or canal flooding. Think about how much food you eat each day. Soil health, along with water supply, is the most valuable resource for humans, as human life depends on the soil’s generosity. that make it useless for a given use. 3. ADVERTISEMENTS: Read this article to learn about the definition, causes, effects, detection, solution and extent of waterlogging. tively poorer quality soil, though this would be at formidable cost. This presentation was made during Regional Conference on the Asian Soil Partnership that took place in Nanjing, China 08-11 Febraury 2012.The presentation was made by Jarwar Attar Khan and it presents Soil survey in Pakistan; history, achievement and impact on agriculture. 1. The minimum soil moisture essential for crop growth varies. Dry scrub forests, called rakhs, grow in parts of the arid plain. Therefore, it is necessary that the irrigation facilities be extended for increasing agricultural output. Everything goes progressively faster as temperature rises between a base and an optimum temperature (p 81), and similarly development sl… The most important effect of temperature is that it affects the rate at which plants develop through their stages (p 8) and produce their leaves, tillers and other components. They are top-of-the-line manner of increasing crop production and of improving the quality of food and fodder. Introduction: “Agriculture is the of process of cultivation of land or soil for production purpose”. This article was taken from here by CareerGuideBD. The Challenges The agriculture sector continues to play a central role in Pakistan's economy, being the second largest sector, accounting for over 25% of GDP. In Pakistan, salinity is one of the country’s most serious environmental problems, caused by human-induced soil erosion and long-term mismanagement of various agricultural practices (World Bank, 2006). According to the latest global environment performance index (EPI) ranking Pakistan is in the list of countries which suffer from poor air quality. Physical removal of topsoil (deterioration of soil surfaces) by various agents, including falling raindrops, water flowing over and through the soil profile, wind velocity. It has created the twin problems of water logging. Environmental issues in Pakistan include air pollution, water pollution, noise pollution, climate change, pesticide misuse, soil erosion, natural disasters, desertification and flooding. Let us shed some light on the problems of the agricultural sector of Pakistan of agricultural problems in Pakistan growth or development in Pakistan. Fertilizers are natural or inorganic substances, both man-made or natural, used to supply parts (akin to nitrogen, phosphate and potash) very important for plant expansion. Special measures to control soil erosion are required on 3.28 m ha exposed to water erosion water erosion Subject Category: Natural Processes The Pakistan Environmental Protection Council, which was first established in 1984, was also reconstituted following the enactment of the 1997 legislation. These soil-transmitted helminths (hookworms, roundworms, whipworms) are transmitted through the fecal-oral route as a result of poor sanitary practices. In these areas the moisture required for structure forma- tion is obtained mainly from river or canal flooding. Therefore, the fertility of soil is decreasing day by day. What different foundation solutions are needed depending on how the building site is classified as regards soil type. ASX00004. A) Soil Health Threats Poor Quality water Over Mechanization Intensive cropping system Poor OM content Harsh climate Poor soil health is threat to Food Security Salinity/Sodicity Soil … The indus plain is made with the deposition of alluvium by the indus river its tributaries. Small and fragmented land-holdings: The seemingly abundance of net sown area of 141.2 million hectares and total cropped area of 189.7 million […] Pakistan Strategic Environmental Assessment of the World Bank, 2006 stated that about 2,000 mgd of wastewater is discharged to surface water bodies in Pakistan. Agriculture plays a very vital role for economy of Pakistan and its development. In Punjab there are two main crops Rabi crops and Kharif crops. The severity of salinity problem in Bangladesh increases with the desiccation of the soil. Classification of environmental problems Current environmental problems/issues in Bangladesh Water pollution Air pollution Deforestation Soil erosion and degradation Drought Depletion of biodiversity Natural calamities Severe overpopulation Water pollution Water pollution is a natural or induced change in the quality of water … Drought-resistant vegetation in the desert consists of stunted thorny scrub, mostly acacia. PROBLEMS Firstly,No mechanism has been adopted to eradicate the soil erosion and even after harvesting nothing is done to improve or restore the soil energy. ISLAMABAD/CHAKWAL: Around 16 million hectares of land, which amounts to 20 percent of the total area of Pakistan, is affected directly or indirectly by soil erosion. In this article, we are going to interface an FC-28 soil moisture sensor with an Arduino.
