We bet you wonder, “How did HOLLYWOODLAND become just HOLLYWOOD?” In 1949 the chamber of commerce worked out a deal for ownership of the sign with the parks department. At first it read "Hollywoodland", but the final four letters were removed in 1949 by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. The intentions of the erection of the “Hollywoodland” sign in 1923 was to advertise the “subdivision” near the top of Mount Lee. As the city was demolishing it, public outcry turned the demolition into a refurbishing project, during which time it was shortened to HOLLYWOOD. In 1923 (or some sources cite 1924), Los Angeles Times publisher Harry Chandler built this massive and enormous sign at a cost of $21,000 (which would be about $265,000 today), initially “HOLLYWOODLAND.”. The sign was created as a real-estate advertisement. By 1923 Los Angeles Times publisher Harry Chandler had decided to invest in an upscale real-estate development called Hollywoodland, which capitalized on the growing recognition of Hollywood as a movie-industry mecca. For the attraction at Disney California Adventure Park, see Hollywood Land. So because a diverse group of people are wearing Avengers-themed outfits, I'm supposed to take that as, "Mission accomplished, DCA has met the standards of celebrating what makes the people and land of California unique?" The area is inspired by the 1930s Golden Age period of Hollywood and hosts attractions themed to this concept, including a backlot of a typical Hollywood studio.
