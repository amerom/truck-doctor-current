It is more commonly known as the sea sparkle because of the bluish light that can be seen “sparkling” in the ocean at night. Noctiluca scintillans grow in large numbers during warmer times of the year, particularly Summer and Autumn. This means that sightings are slightly more likely to occur during this period. Intriguingly, along the west coast of the USA its blooms are not bioluminescent.  The light was emitted by millions upon millions of a single-celled organism: Noctiluca scintillans, or the sea sparkle. Bioluminescence is used as a defense mechanism to startle predators. Halong Bay is located in the Quang Ninh province of Vietnam. Here, we report that the structural organization of its luciferase gene is strikingly … Noctiluca scintillans, a species of bioluminescent plankton, illuminated a stretch of coastline near Hong Kong yesterday in a stunning display that was captured in long exposure photos by photographer Kin Cheung. Noctiluca scintillans is the dominant bioluminescent dinoflagellate in the Matsu archipelago.
