The taxonomic composition and the abundance of two communities of snakes were studied in two different areas of southern Nigeria. The savanna is characterized by grass land with scattered trees. The savanna zone have a high rural population density, they practice shifting cultivation. Ogbomoso is situated in the derived savanna zone of Nigeria lies within latitude 8° 15’ and longitude 4° 15’ The area has an annual rainfall of 1247m with altitude between 200-600m above the sea level while the annual temperature is about 27°C (Ojedapo and Amao, 2014). Insufficient The savanna vegetation may be sub-divided into … There is a shift in the rather precarious balance existing in this tension zone with the result that derived The tropic… The study revealed that most farmers keep a combination of sheep and goats. This paper reports on the pattern found in a sample of derived savanna with a low density of trees in Nigeria.  Mangrove forest. derived savanna zone of Nigeria. The importance of maize is tied to its use both as a basic staple food and its use as major The plots of these savannas alternate with the park savannas and border the banks of the rivers with gallery forests. Ogbomoso lies on the As a result, availability of these sources only last for about two months after raining season in October and by February water scarcity is already at its peaks. Its warmth and high humidity gives it a strong tendency to ascend and produce copious rainfall, which is a result of the condensation of water vapour in the rapidly rising air. It is noted that the increase in population resulting from This climate is influenced by the monsoons  originating from the South Atlantic Ocean, which are brought into the country by the (maritime tropical) MT air mass, a warm moist sea-to-land seasonal wind.

Abstract: In this investigation, an attempt was made to estimate the herbaceous production or the carrying capacity of the derived Savanna vegetation of Anyigba area, Kogi State, Nigeria. The epidemiology of helminth infections in West African dwarf sheep and goats under the traditional husbandry system prevailing in the derived savanna area of eastern Nigeria was studied for 12 months. The tropical monsoon climate, designated by the Köppen climate classification  as "Am", is found in the southern part of the country. A study was conducted to assess the systems of management adopted by small farm holders of sheep, goats and pigs in Oyo State, Nigeria. Typical trees of this zone include Isoberlinia and Cassia The infections observed were due to Haemonchus contortus (87.1%), Trichostrongylus spp. Another theory is that the name was derived from the English term "savanna", a kind of tropical grassland, which was borrowed by the English from Spanish sabana and used in the colonial southeast.

The clarity with which the boundary is defined, whether seen from the air or from ground level, is, throughout most of its length, most striking. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study site The experiment was carried out at the Poultry Unit, Teaching and Research Farm of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, Oyo State, Nigeria. Author information: (1)Nigerian Institute for Trypanosomiasis Research, Kaduna. The vegetation belts are Derived savanna (8%), Guinea (40%), and Sudan Savanna (35%), Usman (2004). Nigeria - a large area including the cities of Ibadan, which means where the forest meets the savanna, the country's capital Abuja, Lokoja where the River Niger and River Benue meet, Enugu, and Makurdi. A 2017 assessment found that 107,116 km², or 16%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Cowpea production in Nigeria could be limited in the Nigeria savanna due to S deficiency [6].

Some of them have trunks twisted from annual fires. Omoogun GA(1), Dipeolu OO, Akinboade OA. Along the southern boundary there is a transition, often remarkably abrupt, to Rain forest, while to the north it merges with the Southern Guinea type of savanna (see Keay 1953, for map). The original forest vegetation is burn annually to derived savanna; meanwhile looking at some areas you can found only a few forest trees remain as evident to show the original forest. The rainforest in Nigeria is built of high-mountainous multi-tiered tropical forests, which contain trees of 40-45 meters. The decline of a Glossina morsitans submorsitans belt in the Egbe area of the derived savanna zone, Kwara State, Nigeria. The production of the crop in Nigeria is undertaken in the forest, derived savanna and southern guinea savanna environments. One community was studied in a derived savanna area (environs of Ejule, 06°54′N, 07°23′E), and one community was studied in a moist rainforest area (environs of Eket, 04°50′N, 07°59′E).

The Savannas of Nigeria and Agricultural Production Nigeria is located in the tropical zone (between latitude 4o and 14oN, and longitude 2oE), with a vast area having savanna vegetation (Figure 1). In the first half of the dry season the savanna looks lifeless, the trees stand bare. 1). The … They found that sulphur deficiency was observed to be most in acute in soil from guinea savannah, followed by those derived from savannah and least acute in soil from the rainforest zone. Ogbomoso is situated in the derived Savanna zone of Nigeria on Longitude 40 151 East of the Greenwich The bending characteristics of this material exceeded that of widely used softwood species from temperate regions ( e.g. In the transition zone between tropical rainforest and savanna in Nigeria the occurrence of periodic fires (usually as a part of the farming activities of the indigenous people) results in a marked change in the structure and botanical composition of the vegetation. A derived savanna originally had forest vegetation which has been transformed over the years to savanna vegetation due to land use or abuse. The research farm is lying on latitude 060 19´ 407´´ N and longitude 08o 07´ 831´´ E at an altitude of about 447 m above sea level with a mean rainfall of between 1700 mm to 2060 mm spreading from April to October annually.

The Nigerian Environmental Study/Action Team (Nigerian Environmental Study/Action Team (NEST) 1991) defined the derived savanna as the transitional forest-savanna mosaic that occurs immediately north of the lowland rainforest belt.It stated that in Nigeria the derived savanna belt covers part of Ogun, Oyo, Kwara, Edo, Anambra, Enugu, Ebonyi, Benue, Cross River and Gongola States, … Groups of trees rise above the grassy sea: drought-resistant kaya, isoberlinia, mitragina. The surface soils in the various Nigerian savanna zones are generally sandy (Kowal and Kassam, 1978). Stretching from east to west across the width of Nigeria is a belt of vegetation termed 'Derived savanna' by Jones (1945) and Keay (1953). The composite bamboo is suitable as a construction material.

Abakaliki, a derived savanna zone of Southeastern Nigeria, as rainy season was winding up. A survey was conducted in the Nigerian derived savanna (from August 1987 to July 1988) on the seasonal fluctuations in the composition of Haemonchus contortus burden of naturally infected West African Dwarf sheep and goats. , Norway spruce), as well as that of some traditionally used hardwood species from … vegetation-type known as ‘derived savanna’. 3.2 Ecological Zones of Nigeria. Data were collected from a total of 25 farms spread over the villages and towns using structured questionnaires. Ogbomoso is situated in the derived savannah zone of Nigeria on Yam is Nigeria’s leading root crop, both in terms of land under cultivation and in the volume and value of production (Agboola, 1979). Among the savanna vegetation in Nigeria, various types of so-called elephant grass predominate. From each ecological zone, a local government area (LGA) with good concentration of C. albidum trees was selected. This vast and empty savanna-like area dotted with Biaro, a local name for temple, obviously derived from Sanskrit vihara. MATERIALS AND METHODS Site of the study Site of the study This research was carried out between July – October, 2008 at the Poultry unit of Teaching and Research Farm of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, Oyo State, Nigeria. The selected LGAs were Akure South (rainforest) and Akoko South west (derived savanna). METHODOLOGY The study was conducted in tropical rainforest and derived savanna ecosystems of Ondo State, Nigeria. Preview Abstract or chapter one below Format: PDF and MS Word (DOC) pages = 65 Such 'derived' savanna, resulting from destruction of forest for agriculture, mainly during the last few centuries, and subsequent repeated burning, shows a similar range in physiognomy to that of 'natural' savanna. Based on the above, Nigeria’s agro-ecological zones can be classified into: – (i) The Mangrove forest and coastal vegetation (ii) The Freshwater swamp forest (iii) The tropical high forest zone (iv) The derived Guinea Savannah (v) The Guinea Savannah zone (vi) The Sudan savannah (Shortgrass savanna) (vii) The Sahel savannah (Marginal Savanna) North of the forest biome is a wide band of Sudan–Guinea Savanna vegetation which covers about 70% of the country. A 2017 assessment found that 107,116 km², or … The Savannas of Nigeria and Agricultural Production  Nigeria is located in the tropical zone (between latitude 4o and 14oN, and longitude 2oE), with a vast area having savanna vegetation (Figure 1). This is a region that is itself diverse, necessitating a classification into derived savanna, southern Guinea savanna and northern Guinea savanna. Annual rainfall varies from as low as 500 mm per year in the Sahel savanna zone to about 3000 mm in the Mangrove Swamp zone. Savannas occur in seasonal climates with a distinct Four-fifths of the land area bears savanna, the remainder being mainly forest or a mosaic of farms and forests. Derived Savanna INTRODUCTION Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a major crop grown in Derived savanna agro-ecology of Nigeria. Nigeria. In South-Eastern Nigeria, the Derived savanna covers parts of Abia, Anambra, Cross River, Ebonyi, |Enugu and Imo States reaching 60 40’ N. About 8 percent (approximately 75,707 sq km) of Nigeria is occupied by this savanna (NEST, 1991). Cassava is one of the major staple foods in Nigeria and it provides major source of calories to many people in African countries (IITA, 2002). They are mahoganies, walnuts, irokos, oil palms, rubber trees, and obeche trees. It is a type of vegetation that is found around the marshes of the coastal creeks, lagoons, and estuaries of southern Nigeria. Map of Nigeria drawn by Keay (1959) quoted by Usman (2004), showing the distribution of vegetation in Nigeria, shows that there are three main types of savanna vegetation in Nigeria, and they occupy about 83% of the total Nigerian surface area. Soil types The ecological zones in Nigeria are based on Keay (1949), and are defined from South to North as follows: Mangrove Swamp and Coastal Vegetation, Freshwater Swamp Forest, Lowland Rain Forest, Derived Savanna, Guinea Savanna, Sudan Savanna, and Sahel Savanna. in derived savanna environment of Nigeria. Derived Savanna is the type of savanna that is derived from Rain forest in which forest and savanna species co-exist side by side (Usman, 2004 ; Bond et al.2005). Savanna is broadly defined as that tropical seasonal ecosystem with a continuous herbaceous cover on the ground, with variable cover of trees and shrubs. Surface waters are the main sources of water in most derived savanna rural communities. Nigerian savanna awakens. North of the zone of the Guinea savanna the amount of precipitation decreases to 500-1000 mm and the dry period lasts more than six-seven months, and a zone of Sudanese savanna with a dense but low grass cover is located. Location of the sites in the moist forests or derived Savannas in Southwest Nigeria did not affect the properties of bamboo-glued boards. (63.8%), metacestodes of Taenia hydatigena (30.2%), Oesophagostomum columbianum (22.4%), … Almost half of the territory of Nigeria is occupied by a moist, so-called Guinean high-grass savanna. SAVANNA AND FOREST IN WESTERN NIGERIA W. B. MORGAN and R. P. MOSS ' I 'HE savanna-forest boundary in West Africa is one of its most remarkable geo-J- graphical features. This is explained MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental Site The experiment was carried out at the Poultry Unit of Teaching and Research Farm, LadokeAkintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, Oyo State, Nigeria. Rangeland Assessment of Derived Savanna around Egume in Kogi state Nigeria Based on Livestock Forage Preference and Palatable Species 1Hemen,T. The vast area of savanna ecology in Africa plays a significant role in food production, making a study of soils in this zone very important. The grass reaches a great height, in which not only a man, but also a large animal can hide. Among the savanna vegetation in Nigeria, various types of so-called elephant grass predominate. Groups of trees rise above the grassy sea: drought-resistant kaya, isoberlinia, mitragina. Some of them have trunks twisted from annual fires. Precipitation pe year here is 1000-1400 mm on the average. Rainfall is bimodal in the Mangrove and Rainforest and parts of the Derived savanna zones and uni-modal in the Guinea, Sudan and Sahel savannas.
