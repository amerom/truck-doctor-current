Extensive green roofs are generally made up of a very thin layer of soil or other planting medium with shallow-root plants like sedum, mosses, and grasses. Instant green roofs. It;s impermeable to the roots and again helps protect both the roof and the sedum. Drainage layer on the roof garden is used to quickly discharge the rainwater from the vegetation layer into the drainage system, as well as to collect excess water. Green roofs are differentiated by the depth of the growing medium, as this directly relates to weight—the primary structural concern. GRS root barriers come in 20 mil, 30 mil, and 40 mil thickness, depending on the application. Growing medium: The soil is usually not more than 5" deep and is sometimes contained by a tray system, which provides a barrier to excessive growth, protects the roof membrane, and also interlocks the entire system together to prevent wind damage.
