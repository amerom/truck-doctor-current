Procalcitonin algorithm to guide initial antibiotic therapy in acute exacerbations of COPD admitted to the ICU: a randomized multicenter study. Procalcitonin-Guided Evaluation and Management of Lower Respiratory Tract Infections and Sepsis Brittany Goldberg, MD, MS Medical Officer . Procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker for critically ill patients to differentiate sepsis from non-infectious triggers of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. ADULT PROCALCITONIN USAGE GUIDELINES Background Procalcitonin (PCT) is a 116 amino acid precursor of calcitonin that has both hormonal and cytokine-like activities. The 2016 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines were published under the auspices of the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) [].After a great deal of deliberation and discussion with SCCM, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) reluctantly elected not to endorse these guidelines. 1 Consequently HCAP was eliminated in the recent IDSA ventilator-associated pneumonia guidelines. Inpatient care if score ≥2. The procalcitonin group had a significantly lower mean duration of antibiotics … IDSA Clinical Practice Guidelines are developed by a panel of experts who perform a systematic review of the available evidence and use the GRADE process to develop evidence-based recommendations to assist practitioners and patients in making decisions about … Compared with patients who tested positive for procalcitonin, patients who tested negative had lower rates of antibiotic initiation (95% vs 71%; P =.001) and lower rates of admission (98% vs 89%; P =.08). 3, 4 Some major changes were made in the methodology, including use of the Patient/Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO) framework and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation … In the emergency department, clinicians adhered to the procalcitonin guideline recommendation for 577 of 792 patients (72.9%) in the procalcitonin group for whom results were obtained and reported. Sputum stain and culture/Blood Cultures: -NOT recommended for CAP in the outpatient setting. What are Some of the Highlights of the 2016 IDSA Nosocomial Pneumonia Guidelines: In patients with suspected HAP/VAP, procalcitonin and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) testing are not recommended initially. These guidelines were reviewed and endorsed by NCS and SHEA. In 2016, IDSA/ATS updated guidelines on ventilator-associated pneumonia as well as Hospital-acquired pneumonia which were discussed in comparison with European guidelines here. Thus a procalcitonin rise on day 1, compared to its "before" level, had 41% sensitivity and 85% specificity for diagnosing VAP, with respective positive and negative predictive values of 68% and 65%. 2011 Jul; 16(5): 819-24. It answers these 16 key questions. Procalcitonin's greatest utility may be for guiding early antibiotic discontinuation in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Discontinuation of antibiotics based on defined procalcitonin thresholds has been shown to reduce antibiotic use without adverse outcomes ( algorithm 1) [ 27,28 ]. One reason for the weak recommendation is that the control groups in the studies identified had antibiotic durations of 9 to 15 days. The panel followed a process used by IDSA in the development of other guidelines. Over time it became clear that HCAP isn't an accurate predictor of whether the patient has drug-resistant organisms. Background: This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia. The previous guideline did not cover use of the biomarker procalcitonin. Process Overview, Literature Selection, and Consensus Development Based on Evidence. Clinicians were allowed to overrule the algorithm and start antibiotics in patients with respiratory or hemodynamic instability, pneumonia due to Legionella pneumophila, or other risk factors for poor outcomes regardless of procalcitonin level. Respirology. IDSA-ATS guideline recommends that procalcitonin can be used to de-escalate antibiotic therapy in patients with vap based on the meta-analysis of three controlled randomized test panelists. Purpose To provide an updated joint ASCO/Infectious Diseases Society of American (IDSA) guideline on outpatient management of fever and neutropenia in patients with cancer. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America. The guidelines recommend empiric antibiotic therapy for presumed CAP regardless of initial serum procalcitonin. This guideline focuses on adults with community vs hospital-acquired pneumonia who have not traveled and who have a normal immune response. We recommend not routinely using corticosteroids in nonsevere CAP. Although procalcitonin (PCT) testing has been promoted for discriminating bacterial from viral causes of infection, thereby averting unnecessary antibiotic use, the 2019 ATS/IDSA guidelines on management of community acquired pneumonia recommend against use of PCT to guide antibiotic prescribing in such patients (NEJM JW Infect Dis Dec 2019 and Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2019; … . Procalcitonin (PCT): A calcitonin-related gene product. Moreover, patients who tested negative for procalcitonin had reduced duration of antibiotics (P <.001) and shorter lengths of stay (P =.004). 2 The elimination of HCAP creates a definitional vacuum, because it's unclear how to classify these patients currently. Gaithersburg, MD With respect to the former question, the authors give a ‘strong recommendation’ based on ‘moderate evidence’ that procalcitonin … As the current guidelines restrict themselves to ‘clinically and radiographically-confirmed’ CAP, the question addressed is whether or not procalcitonin can distinguish between bacterial and viral CAP. Since then, much has changed. The IDSA group agrees with therapy as soon as possible for those with severe infections (presumably with shock) but is concerned that “stipulating an aggressive, fixed time period” may lead to broad-spectrum agents frequently being given to uninfected patients in … November 10, 2016 . Let’s get you up to speed. 2019 IDSA/ATS CAP Recommendations o “We recommend that empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated in adults with clinically suspected and radiographically confirmed CAP regardless of initial serum procalcitonin level (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)” Pneumonia – change in treatment guidelines. (M) Q10 Aspiration pneumonia . The previous version was published back in 2007 and the new guidelines have included some major changes. Methods: We assessed the clinical utility of procalcitonin in 2 prospective studies: first, a multicenter diagnostic study in patients presenting to the emergency department with acute dyspnea to directly compare the diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin with that of interleukin 6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the diagnosis of pneumonia; second, a randomized management study of procalcitonin guidance … In this multicentre, randomised clinical trial we observed a benefit of incorporating procalcitonin into the antibiotic reduction strategy suggested by current ATS/IDSA guidelines. The new guidelines are based on changing evidence and clinical picture of community-acquired pneumonia. ATS/IDSA 2019 Updates to CAP Guidelines. using the 2016 guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and American Thoracic Society (ATS),1 as well as recent literature regarding controversial topics such as the role for procalcitonin testing and adjunctive inhaled aminoglycosides. (M) We suggest no routine use in influenza PNA. Procalcitonin can serve as a helpful adjunct to clinical judgment for guiding antibiotic therapy and resolving diagnostic uncertainty in patients with known or suspected lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). Results Six … ANMC ADULT Procalcitonin (PCT) Utilization Guideline/Clinical Pathway Scope of Guideline: This guideline is ONLY intended for use in ADULT patients (>18 y/o) and for utilization in the evaluation of procalcitonin levels in patients with the disease states indicated below (i.e. Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. Q5 Procalcitonin. Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions Or Home Isolation Although there is data to support use of procalcitonin in determining the duration of antibiotics in CAP 9,10, the guidelines recommend use only in situations where duration exceeds the recommended 5-7 days. 5. The guidelines recommend use of the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) over the CURB-65 for determining need for admission TERMS HAP is …  We generally obtain a procalcitonin level at the time of diagnosis and repeat the level every one to two days, depending on severity of illness. We determine the need for continued antibiotic therapy based on the patient's clinical course, suspected etiology, serial procalcitonin levels, and microbiologic tests results. 1. The last CAP guidelines were released in 2007. (H) We suggest no routine use in severe CAP. lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) and sepsis). Procalcitonin has previously been used to help guide clinicians in the initiation of antibiotics in LRTI, but there were concerns of varied sensitivity of the test (range 38-91%) might miss patients with bacterial causes. No differences in 30-day pneumonia readmission were … Our approach is consistent with the 2016 IDSA and ATS guidelines, which strongly recommend using clinical criteria alone, rather than procalcitonin plus clinical criteria, to decide whether to start antibiotics . Q7: Should a clinical prediction rule for prognosis plus clinical judgement versus clinical judgement … Severe pneumonia if score 3-5 (IDSA CAP g/l 2007). Here is a rundown of all those changes that you need to know. -Recommended for inpatients: -Classified as severe CAP. The investigators also recommended stopping antibiotics if procalcitonin levels decreased by ≥80% when the initial procalcitonin was >5–10 µg/L. -Previously infected with MRSA or P. Aeruginosa. These guidelines were also reviewed and approved by the IDSA SPGC and the Board of Directors (BOD). It has been recently shown that PCT is a valuable tool to guide antibiotic treatment in patients with bacteria infections. Use of procalcitonin to shorten antibiotic treatment duration in septic patients: a randomized trial. Instead, clinical criteria alone should be used to decide whether or not to initiate empiric antibiotic treatment. Nobre V, Harbarth S, Graf JD, Rohner P, Pugin J. American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. December 20, 2019. This is an epic guideline and, as such, is a pretty long post. The guidelines provide a weak recommendation for the use of procalcitonin levels plus clinical criteria to make the decision on whether to discontinue antibiotic therapy in patients with HAP/VAP. Guidelines for the management of adults with hospital-acquired, ventilator-associated, and … Additional testing and labs: Consider checking blood cultures, sputum cultures (Dr Centor is not a fan), legionella urinary Ag, pneumococcal urinary Ag. -Empirically treated for MRSA and P. Aeruginosa. Methods: A multidisciplinary panel conducted pragmatic systematic reviews of the relevant research and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations. Health care associated pneumonia (HCAP) no longer exists HCAP… Metlay JP, Waterer GW, Long AC, Anzueto A, Brozek J, Crothers K, et al. CDRH/OIR/DMD/BAC2 . Procalcitonin (PCT) is a 116 amino acid precursor of calcitonin which under normal circumstances is produced by the thyroid C-cells. A substantial revision of the 2007 American Thoracic Society (ATS)/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) CAP guideline was published in 2019. Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2019 Oct 1;200(7):e45-67. Normally it is produced locally in the thyroid gland by C-cells. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a peptide measurable in serum which becomes elevated in response to bacterial infection. Conclusions: Crude values and procalcitonin rise had poor diagnostic value for VAP in this particular setting and thus should not be used to initiate antibiotics when VAP is clinically suspected. The guidelines suggest that clinicians use de-escalated rather than fixed antibiotic therapy and that they use procalcitonin levels plus clinical criteria to guide the discontinuation of therapy. The guideline recommended a β-lactam (eg, ampicillin-sulbactam, ceftriaxone, or cefotaxime) plus either a macrolide (eg, azithromycin or clarithromycin) or doxycycline as combination therapy or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (eg, levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) as monotherapy for low-risk inpatients, whereas a β-lactam plus a macrolide or fluoroquinolone is recommended for high-risk inpatients. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines recommend “that administration of IV antimicrobials be initiated as soon as possible after recognition and within 1 hour for both sepsis and septic shock (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence; grade applies to both conditions).”. regardless of initial serum procalcitonin level. The 2007 guidelines for management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) endorsed by IDSA and the American Thoracic Society recommend a “minimum” of five days of antibiotic therapy for CAP and that patients must meet clinical stability criteria (afebrile for at least 48 hours, stable vital signs) for antibiotics to be discontinued. Thus, serum concentrations of PCT are usually undetectable. The guideline recommendations were based on the review of evidence by the Expert Panel. (L) Methods ASCO and IDSA convened an Update Expert Panel and conducted a systematic review of relevant studies. The question not asked in these guidelines is whether or not procalcitonin can differentiate lower from upper respiratory tract infections. Intensive Care Med. More recently, two newprovided additional support for this IDSA/ATS recommendation (6.7). These guidelines also make a weak recommendation for using procalcitonin in addition to clinical criteria when discontinuing antibiotics. The 2019 guideline recommends that empiric antibiotic therapy be initiated in adults with clinically suspected and radiographically confirmed CAP, regardless of initial serum procalcitonin level (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). . We recommend that empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated in adults. 2018; 44 : … Long W, Deng X, Zhang YU, Lu G, Xie J, Tang J. Procalcitonin guidance for reduction of antibiotic use in low-risk outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia. The new 2019 ATS/IDSA guidelines reaffirm many recommendations from the guidelines published in 2007, with several changes made 1: The implementation of a narrower scope (time of diagnosis, to the end of treatment) with less focus on epidemiology or pathogenesis 1. Serum concentrations of PCT are normally <0.05 ng/mL but in circumstances of systemic inflammation, particularly bacterial infection, PCT is produced in large quantities by many body tissues. The ATS and IDSA recently released the much-anticipated update to the community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines. Critically ill patients are frequently at risk of sepsis or inflammatory conditions. See Table 3 in IDSA pocket card for details.
