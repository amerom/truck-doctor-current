You may choose to submit your manuscript as a single Word or PDF file to be used in the refereeing … The Journal of Materials Engineering and Applications is an open access Journal aimed towards exploring novel strategies in the field of Applied Engineering. The Journal is a treasure trove of scientific literature on all aspects of material engineering. The online version is free access and download. Polymer engineering is a strongly interdisciplinary field and papers published by the journal may span areas such as polymer physics, polymer processing and engineering of polymer-based materials and their applications. However, these materials cannot be controlled artificially after implantation, which may result in poor repair performance. The effect of non-reactive Argon (Ar) and reactive Oxygen (O2) environments on the surface, structural and mechanical characteristics of nano-second pulsed laser-ablated Aluminum (Al) has been revealed. Numan Ahmed, a Hong ... School of Materials Science and Engineering, Xi'an 710119, China Abstract. The International Journal of Materials Engineering strives to publish articles related to fundamental properties of engineering materials, mechanical characterisation, how they are controlled by processing, formed, joined and finished, and how all of these factors influence the selection and design of materials in real-world engineering applications. Rock-like materials refer to geological materials and engineering materials such as rock and concrete. Editor in Chief Dr. M.A. Key Engineering Materials, 2009, 419–420: 125–128. Civil Engineering civil engineering materials CONSTRUCTION & BUILDING TECHNOLOGY. The Journal of Materials: Design and Applications is a forum for communication of both fundamental research and application areas in the field of the design and application of engineering materials, predominantly within the context of mechanical engineering applications.
