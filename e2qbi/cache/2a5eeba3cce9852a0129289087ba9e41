It is the most popular breed of sheep used for clothing and produces the most luxurious wool, famous for its fine staples at about 20-25 microns in diameter (superfine merino can sometimes be down to 17 microns) and a soft hand feel. While merino wool is an unparalleled thermal fibre (it wicks moisture, prevents the build up of bacteria and odours, retains heat even when wet, and is soft enough be worn directly on the skin), it’s fine nature makes it somewhat fragile (it wears quickly).
